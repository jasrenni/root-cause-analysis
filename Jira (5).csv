At one time when the group submissions were working well for LTI, (a very brief period before they broke again), the instructor did see the regular grading screen for the sticky grader when clicking on a group submission.

Now, the instructor has to select Student Data from the Instructor drop-down, which then lists all the students who have submitted. I only had 3 group submissions, so I could easily figure out which student needed to be graded, but in a course with 50 or 100 students and many groups, this may be very frustrating to the instructor.

This is the only issue I found. Otherwise the LTI group stuff is working well!",{},,08/Aug/24 12:27 AM;557058:718cd3f6-5ff9-42fa-8914-b4224aff1730;Yikes - a regression it would seem - I will get on this.  Thanks.,,To Do,8/7/2024 19:46

If you need help backporting it to an official 22.x we could help you out with that.

See the attached files for examples. In the class I exported from, there were no gradebook items, but two students had course grade overrides

NoItems = The default export - Student ID, Student Name, Gradebook Item Scores, Gradebook Item Comments

Items_CourseGrade_Override = Student ID, Student Name, Gradebook Item Scores, Gradebook Item Comments, Course Grade, Grade Override



I assume that the example items are added to the export to help inexperienced instructors edit the export file for re-import.

T&Q: Calculated question rounding error for answer key,SAK-50321,67848,Bug,Resolved,SAK,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Major,Fixed,Sean Horner,557058:38ecdcf2-1531-4ba3-967f-08694ec3676d,Sean Horner,557058:38ecdcf2-1531-4ba3-967f-08694ec3676d,7/22/2024 19:24,8/7/2024 16:57,8/8/2024 1:36,8/7/2024 16:57,20.6,21.6 [Tentative],22.6 [Tentative],,Tests & Quizzes (Samigo),,"The Answer key can display an incorrect value due to a rounding error for an edge case like the following.

For example, suppose a very precise and correct answer for a formula is “2.6454798891706”. Now suppose the formula is configured to display 3 decimal places for the correct answer. The answer key currently presents the correct answer with a rounding error.

* Currently: The answer key displays as 2.646.
* Expected: The answer key should display as 2.645.

This rounding error happens because SamigoExpressionParser.parse returns the string “2.6455” as the answer, which is rounded again downstream (by some client code) to 2.646. These kinds of rounding errors could be prevented by modifying the parse method to return a string with an extra decimal place of precision (e.g., “2.6548” would be rounded to the expected “2.645”).

For what it’s worth, I encountered this problem by testing the following trigonometry example from the T&Q help document, How do I create a calculated question? 

Solve: COS({a}) * ({c} - {b}) = {{z}}

A student’s case arose where variable values resulted in:

COS(4.087) * (3.652 - 8.171)

Using a [+scientific calculator+|https://www.desmos.com/scientific] --with angles set to radians (instead of degrees)-- I discovered that a precise answer like 2.6454798891706 would be presented in the answer key as 2.646 instead of 2.645 (with the default setting of 3 decimal places).","{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2024-08-07T16:57:49.000-0400"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""GitHub"":{""count"":1,""name"":""GitHub""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,"22/Jul/24 8:03 PM;557058:f58131cb-b67d-43c7-b30d-6b58d40bd077;A pull request has been created, ""SAK-50321 T&Q: Calculated question rounding error for answer key"", you can see it at https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/pull/12750",,Done,8/7/2024 16:57

It is available for download from [+GitHub+|https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/releases] and [+SourceForge+|https://sourceforge.net/projects/ldap-sdk/files/], and it is available in the [+Maven Central Repository+|https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.unboundid/unboundid-ldapsdk/7.0.1]. You can find the release notes for this release (and all previous versions) at [https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/release-notes.html|https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/release-notes.html|smart-link] , but here’s a summary of the changes:

* We added a new {{MaximumIdleDurationLDAPConnectionPoolHealthCheck}} class that can be used to replace connections that have remained idle for longer than a specified length of time. We generally recommend setting a maximum connection age for the pool so that connections are automatically replaced after a given amount of time regardless of their activity, but the new health check can be used as an alternative if you want to keep active connections around as long as possible while also ensuring that idle connections are closed by the LDAP SDK before they might be closed by the LDAP server or by intermediate network equipment.
* We updated the in-memory directory server to improve its concurrency when processing operations that don’t need to make changes to the data, including binds, searches, and compares.
* We added new {{Filter.createSubstringAssertion}} methods that can be used to create properly encoded string representations of substring assertions. This can be particularly helpful when you want to create an extensible matching filter using a substring matching rule.
* We updated the {{KeyStoreKeyManager}} and {{TrustStoreTrustManager}} classes to make it possible to use an alternative security provider when accessing the associated key or trust store. We’ve also made it possible to indicate whether the LDAP SDK should be allowed to access non-FIPS-compliant key stores when operating in FIPS 140-2-compliant mode.
* We fixed an issue in which the {{parallel-update}} tool would use an in-memory buffer to hold information about information to write to the reject file, but it would not automatically flush that buffer when changes are rejected. In some cases, this could introduce a significant delay between the time that a change is rejected and the time that a record of it was written to the specified log file.
* We fixed an issue with the {{manage-certificates}} tool that could prevent it from accessing the JVM’s default trust store in cases where the LDAP SDK is operating in FIPS 140-2-compliant mode and the tool is invoked programmatically (as opposed to running it from the command line).
* We updated the command-line tool framework to make it possible for tools to expose arguments for generating a debug log file. All of the tools included with the LDAP SDK have been updated to provide this option, and you can use the {{--help-debug}} argument to see the applicable arguments.
* We updated the debug logging framework to make it possible to write debug messages, which are formatted as JSON objects, using a multi-line representation rather than the default single-line representation. People looking at the log messages may find the multi-line format easier to read.
* We added a new {{StaticUtils.setSystemPropertyIfNotAlreadyDefined}} method that can be used to set the value of a specified system property in the JVM, but only if it’s not already set (in which case its current value will be preserved).
* We added client-side support for a new “verify password” extended request in the Ping Identity Directory Server that properly authorized clients (under a restricted set of circumstances) can use to determine whether a given password is valid for a specified user without performing any other password policy processing.
* We updated the OID registry to include records for a number of collation matching rules supported in the Ping Identity Directory Server, ForgeRock OpenDJ, Oracle OUD, and other servers.","{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2024-07-16T13:35:54.000-0400"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""GitHub"":{""count"":1,""name"":""GitHub""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,"16/Jul/24 1:36 AM;557058:f58131cb-b67d-43c7-b30d-6b58d40bd077;A pull request has been created, ""SAK-50299 Update UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java 7.0.1"", you can see it at https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/pull/12736",,Done,7/16/2024 13:35
LTI Tools set to open in a new window require you to click a button to open the new window,SAK-50298,67825,Bug,Closed,SAK,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Major,Fixed,Andrea Schmidt,557058:093e0ced-45f4-4932-853a-c54031e22f52,Wilma Hodges,557058:89b0bd66-0f67-42a4-b388-c7dbb7ceaa2d,7/15/2024 15:48,8/5/2024 21:23,8/8/2024 1:36,7/25/2024 13:09,23.2,25.0 [Tentative],,25.0 [Tentative],LTI,,"The behavior of LTI tools set to open in a new window seems to have changed. In prior versions, selecting the “Always open in popup” setting for an LTI tool that is located in the site navigation resulted in a new window opening up when the tool link in the left nav is selected. (The behavior was similar to what happens now if you put a Web Content link in the left nav and tell it to open in a new window. Clicking on the item in the tool menu launches the new window automatically. )

However, the current behavior for LTI tools set to open in a new window is to display a button that says “Open tool in a new window” and the user has to click that button to launch the tool. This is a change in behavior and requires more clicking to get to the tool, so some of our clients have complained about it.  

*Dev notes:* In investigating this, the new behavior was introduced in [https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-47878|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-47878|smart-link] which is in master/25 and went back to 23.0 and 22.4.  The code in that Jira had two flaws: (1) It did not consult the tool’s assertion about launching in a new page which can be (always, never, or let the content decide) and (2) the sakai-lti-popup webcomponent simply had no “please auto press the button feature”.

In Assignments, even if the setting is set to Always launch in Popup for the tool, if the checkbox within assignments (Load this tool in a new tab) is not checked, the tool will always load in an iframe.

If the checkbox is checked in assignments, then the student has to click twice to get to the tool (but it does open in a new tab/window): 1. Go to External Tool 2. Launch External Tool in New Window

* If the tool was added by an admin to always launch in popup, can’t that setting be passed to assignments?
* When the assignment recognizes the tool is to be opened in a new window, can’t that be done when clicking Go to External Tool?

From Chuck: This might not want to go back to 23-x - there is an easy workaround in 23-x - just use the checkbox in the assignment,  It turns out to be a good bit of code to make it work well.","{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=OPEN, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2024-08-07T16:51:56.000-0400"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""OPEN"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":true},""byInstanceType"":{""GitHub"":{""count"":1,""name"":""GitHub""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,"05/Aug/24 9:24 PM;557058:718cd3f6-5ff9-42fa-8914-b4224aff1730;Make sure to re-test [https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-50298|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-50298|smart-link] - this patch touches some of that code since they now share logic, the new window logic was moved into a utility class and is now directly used both places.",,In Progress,8/5/2024 21:19

If the admin adds a single LTI tool (Resource Link launch), the admin needs to do multiple updates before the tool can be saved.

Once the Dynamic Registration process has finished, by default, the following values are set:

# *Allow tool title to be changed*: Allow
# *Allow launch URL to be changed*: Allow
# *Launch URL*
# *Indicate where in the Sakai User interface that these tools should appear*: all are checked except navigation
# *The launch URL for this tool must support at least one launch message type. Most tools support one or the other, but some tools do support both messages at one URL*.: The tool URL supports a ""resource picker"" experience with one or more tools (Deep Link launch)

Logically, the admin would go from top to bottom to modify the values as needed. Once 1 and 2 have been changed to Do not allow, the launch URL is changed, modifying where the tools should appear and the launch type, it gets complicated. 

It doesn’t seem to matter which order they are modified, but #1 and #2 *automatically change back to “Allow”*. If the admin isn’t aware that these values have changed (since they were modified first and assumed to be kept), the tool will be saved with the tool title and launch URL allowing to be changed.

If #5 were at the top, the launch type could be selected first, but this will only work if the selections for where the tools are to be placed aren’t set by default. ",{},,,,To Do,7/14/2024 9:31

{quote}Define variables in the question text by surrounding the variable name with single curly braces ( e.g. {x} and {y} )
Define global variables in the question text by surrounding the variable name with single at ( e.g. @x1@ and @y1@ )
+When a student views the question, variable and global variable placeholders will be replaced with the variable values+{quote}

Where it says, ""global variable placeholders will be replaced with the variable values"" this does not happen. When you use @x1@, the student sees the formula with the {} variables replaced . To see the value of the global variable, it must be written as a calculation: [[@x1@]]. Personally, I like it to work this way. It allows the teacher to print both the formula and the value on the screen.

With this in mind, I find it more convenient to update the instructions rather than correct the behavior:

{quote}Define variables in the question text by surrounding the variable name with single curly braces ( e.g. {x} and {y} )
Define global variables in the question text by surrounding the variable name with single at ( e.g. @x1@ and @y1@ )
+When a student views the question, variable placeholders will be replaced with the variable values. Global variable placeholders will be replaced with the formulas.+{quote}

{quote}Define formula placeholders in the question text by surrounding the formula name with double curly braces ( e.g. {{z}} )
When the student views the question, formula placeholders will be replaced with input boxes
+Internal calculations using the variables can be added using double square brackets [[]]. The calculation result will be shown in the question text (e. g. [[{x}+{y}]] or [[@x1@ + @y1@]]). Global variable placeholders will be replaced with their values using double square brackets [[]] (e.g., [[@x1@]]).+{quote}

The original work was done in Canvas along with an ex-Canvas employee who worked at Lumen Learning who wanted iframes to be really great from a UI perspective.  An informal ad hoc spec was created and some sample code was shared.  Ironically much of the original work was started at a meeting in North Quad at the University of Michigan School of Information and over lunch at the Jerk Pit. 

The early message types were supported in Canvas, Sakai, and Moodle.  Several of the message types like ‘lti.frameResize’ became pretty widely supported because it was so useful and so easy to implement.

Over time, the actual 1EdTech specs started using post messages to solve little problems like the need to close the dynamic registration popup at the end of the process and handling the increasingly challenging “cookie in an iframe problem”.

The Sakai documentation has lagged behind Sakai’s support for these messages - so this Jira catches things up documentation-wise.

I feel like I remember looking at this ~10 years ago and fixing it was either a huge effort or impossibility back then because of the lack of support in iCal4j.

Now it looks like iCal4x has a released a 4.x version using the new Java Date/Time API. I’m not sure the effort in converting this over to using this new library. 

So fixing this now _seems_ more possible than it was years ago with 3.x. Have you looked into this at all? There’s not many comments on those old tickets. ",,Done,7/29/2024 15:13

That way, an institution would have the option to select a different default layout, perhaps a 2 or 3 column layout, where the widgets are more easily seen next to the MOTD, regardless of the size of the message.

While the issue called out in that Jira (the timestamps for file attachments) has already been addressed, the T&L/UX group felt that additional improvements could be made to the history so that it is more condensed and easier to follow. 

I’m proposing the following UI changes for the instructor view of Grader:

* The addition of the time stamp for inline submissions. (Currently there are only time stamps for the file uploads.)
* The addition of a “submission history” section at the top which can be expanded to show prior submission attempts, along with their associated inline and/or file attachments and time stamps, grouped by submission date.
* The ability to click on an item in the submission history and view that item in the content area below. 
** This would allow the instructor to compare prior attempts with the current one. 
** To avoid confusion over which submission is currently being graded, the “Grade Submission” button would become disabled when viewing prior submissions, and a note at the top would remind the instructor that they are not viewing the most recent submission.
** The inline submission text would appear in “student view” mode with the instructor comments inserted if applicable, similar to the previous submission that is displayed in the student view when they go in to resubmit. 
* The currently selected item for viewing is indicated in bold text.

See mockups of the proposed changes below.

Add email notification and calendar options to assessment Settings in Tests & Quizzes,SAK-50259,67786,Feature Request,Open,SAK,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Major,,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Wilma Hodges,557058:89b0bd66-0f67-42a4-b388-c7dbb7ceaa2d,6/27/2024 15:13,6/28/2024 2:27,8/8/2024 1:36,,23.3 [Tentative],25.0 [Tentative],,,Tests & Quizzes (Samigo),,"Recently, there was a new feature introduced which automatically sends email notifications to site participants  when an assessment becomes available. While this makes sense in theory, in practice it may be overwhelming for courses where there are a lot of assessments that all open on the same day. Unfortunately, there is no way for an instructor to control whether or not these email notifications go out, since there is no option in the UI to enable/disable this feature. 

The T&L/UX group recently discussed this issue, and we felt that the best approach would be surfacing the option in the UI, so that the instructor could choose to turn it on or off.

Therefore, we would like to propose adding this as a check box in the Settings screen within Tests& Quizzes, just after the Availability Date, since the email announcement is closely tied to that date. 

In addition, the T&L/UX also felt that adding the option to display the due date on the Calendar as a check box in Settings would also be beneficial for users. This option is currently only found in the Publish confirmation screen, which makes it impossible to enable/disable on a published assessment without retracting and republishing the item. Since the calendar entry is closely tied to the due date for the assessment, it makes sense to add it just beneath the Due Date section. 

See proposed mockup below:

!t&q-settings-email-notification-and-calendar.png|width=100%,alt=""t&q-settings-email-notification-and-calendar.png""!

Additionally, it is worth noting that there is another email notification option which can be selected on the Publish confirmation screen, which sends an email notification at the time of publishing (even though the assessment may or may not be available yet). See screenshot of current UI below:

!t&q-publish-email-notification-and-calendar.png|width=91.66666666666666%,alt=""t&q-publish-email-notification-and-calendar.png""!

T&L/UX questioned the usefulness of this option, since it may not be immediately actionable if the assessment availability date is the in the future. Also, if the notification is sent both upon publication, and upon availability, it could result in multiple notifications for the same item and students may feel as if they are being spammed. Originally, I was tempted to add this option to the Settings screen as well, so that it could at least be viewed alongside the other email notification and enabled/disabled from there. However, upon reflection, I think it is probably a rarely used option, and may be unnecessary given the new “email upon availability” feature. I’d be interested to hear from folks in the comments whether or not they use this “email upon publish” option, or whether it can be removed to avoid over-notifying users.",{},,,,To Do,6/27/2024 15:13

However, during my testing, only the Chat, Lessons, and Resources Tools yielded any search results.

 

We’re in need of a developer to go through and test each of these advanced search options and Tools to verify whether the described functionality exists/applies to Sakai 23, while adding/updating help documentation to include any Sakai-specific terms/keystrokes which are needed to perform these advanced searches.

 

Advanced search options needing to be verified/updated with Sakai-specific terms/keystrokes:

 

·         Include the key word “Site” to narrow the search for a particular term to a specified Course Site

·         Include the key word “Tool” to narrow your search for a particular term to a specified Tool

·         Include the key word “Title” to search for items with that Title

·         Include the key word “Title” to narrow your search for a particular term appearing in an item with that Title

·         Combine multiple terms together with Boolean operators

·         Perform a single character wild card search

·         Perform a multiple character wild card search

·         Perform a fuzzy search for a term

·         Specify a fuzzy search parameter by entering a value between 0 and 1

·         Perform a proximity search for two terms within so many words of one another in a document

·         Perform an inclusive range query

·         Perform an exclusive range query

·         Boost a search term by adding a boost factor next to a term to make it more relevant

Can this option - to randomly draw from fixed positions across a number of question pools - be added as an additional option when drawing from a question pool? 



Currently in test and quizzes, one has two options for th random draw from a question bank:

# A student's questions are randomized each time an assessment is submitted
# A student's questions are randomized once for all submissions

Previously, option 2 had the following impact:

# If there for example 11 questions and one draws 1 question, a specific student would always get question no 4. The number was random, but fixed for all the tests, even if one coppied the test and quiz. The advantage is one could build questions that build ontop of each other. 

For example one has 4 qustion banks, with 11 questions each. In the old option the student alway got the same question. Thus in Question bank 1 the inputs for a numerical question was given, and one value was asked. Question bank 2 one could use the same inputs and ask a part b of the qustion. This happened because one knew that the student gets the same number in the 11 qeustion sequence. 

However this changed. It is now totally random.
# The second impact is that when republish an old test, a student get new values. I wanted to use the same test values, for student who did not get ie 50%, but they could use the same values. However this does not work anymore.

My suggestion is that there is a thirds option ie

# A student's questions are *fixed* randomized once for all submissions. Thus a student will always get the same question in any test where this option is used.

I hope this clear, as I build many numerical tests on this option.",{},,"27/Jun/24 6:53 PM;70121:edd71bdf-212f-4544-92f7-2fc8fb688af3;[~accountid:6164efde289a54006a78de04], is the fixed randomization you’re talking about look like what was fixed in [https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/issues/SAK-43768|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/issues/SAK-43768]?",,To Do,6/30/2024 8:53

It is available for download from [+GitHub+|https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/releases] and [+SourceForge+|https://sourceforge.net/projects/ldap-sdk/files/], and it is available in the [+Maven Central Repository+|https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.unboundid/unboundid-ldapsdk/7.0.0]. You can find the release notes for this release (and all previous versions) at [+https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/release-notes.html+|https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/release-notes.html], but here’s a summary of the changes:

* The LDAP SDK now requires Java 8 or later. Java 7 is no longer supported.
* We improved the behavior of LDAP connection pools when they are configured to invoke a health check when checking out a connection from the pool. Previously, if a connection was found to be invalid during checkout, the LDAP SDK would create a new connection to replace it, but would continue iterating through other connections in the pool trying to find an existing valid connection. It will now return the newly created connection immediately without checking other existing connections, which can substantially reduce the time to check out a connection in a scenario where many connections have been invalidated (e.g., by a server shutdown).
* We added a new {{compare-ldap-schemas}} command-line tool that can be used to identify differences between the schemas of two LDAP servers.
* We improved the behavior that the LDAP SDK uses when authenticating with the GSSAPI SASL mechanism. Previously, if you didn’t explicitly provide a JAAS configuration file to use for the attempt, the LDAP SDK would create a new one for each bind attempt. This would create a lot of temporary files that would need to be cleaned up when the JVM exited, and they might not get cleaned up properly if they JVM exits abnormally (e.g., it’s killed or if the JVM crashes). It would also require a small amount of additional memory for each bind attempt, since it has to remember another file to be deleted. Now, the LDAP SDK will be able to reuse the same generated configuration file for all GSSAPI bind requests that use the same JAAS settings, which will slightly improve performance, reduce memory usage, and reduce disk space consumption.
* We added experimental client-side support for the relax rules support as defined in [+draft-zeilenga-ldap-relax-03+|https://docs.ldap.com/specs/draft-zeilenga-ldap-relax-03.txt]. This draft doesn’t specify an OID for the control, but at least a couple of servers (OpenLDAP and ForgeRock OpenDJ) have implemented support for the control with an OID of 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.5.12, so the LDAP SDK uses that OID for the control.
* We added client-side support for a number of proprietary controls used by the ForgeRock OpenDJ directory server. These include:
** A transaction ID request control, which can be included in an operation request to provide a transaction ID that will appear in the access log message for that operation.
** A replication repair request control, which can be included in a write request to indicate that the associated change should not be replicated.
** Change sequence number request and response controls, which can be used with a write operation to obtain the replication CSN that the server assigned to that operation.
** Affinity request control, which can be included in related requests sent through an LDAP proxy server to consistently route them to the same LDAP server instance.
* We added connection pool health checks for use in conjunction with the Ping Identity Directory Server, including:
** One that will attempt to determine whether there are any active alerts in the server that cause it to consider itself to be either degraded or unavailable.
** One that will assess the replication backlog and can consider a server unavailable if it has too many outstanding changes, or if the oldest outstanding change was originally processed too long ago.
** One that will attempt to determine whether the server is in lockdown mode.
* We updated the {{CryptoHelper}} class to add convenience methods for generating SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 digests from byte arrays, strings, and files. There are also generic versions of these methods that can be used with user-specified digest algorithms.
* We added methods for normalizing JSON values and JSON object filters. This can help make it possible to compare two JSON object filters to determine whether two JSON object filters are equivalent.
* We updated the {{BouncyCastleFIPSHelper}} class to add a constant with the name of a system property that can be used to enable support for the MD5 digest algorithm, which may be needed if you’re using the 1.0.2.4 or later version of the bc-fips jar file and need to use the MD5 message digest for some reason.
* We updated the documentation to include new and updated versions of a number of LDAP-related Internet Drafts, including:

There have already been many changes to External Tools recently and it would be good if stealthed tools could get looked at.

Since the placement options have changed in 25x and 23x, allowing the following, the stealthed tool still only places the tool in the navigation no matter what is selected:

* Allow the tool to be placed in site-level navigation
* Allow the tool to be selected from Lessons
* Allow the tool to be one of the assignment types
* Allow the tool to be used from the rich text editor

When a tool is stealthed and is added to a site, there is an option to add it to the navigation, but I did some testing with that box unchecked.

* The site that had the tool added actually displayed it in Site Info > Manage Tools and allowed the instructor to select it.
* In a site that did not have the tool added, it did not display in Site Info > Manage Tools

The CK Editor shopping cart recently had some nice changes ( [https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-50205|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-50205|smart-link] ), showing resource URLs in the top part. If the Site Info > Manage Tools is smart enough to recognize when the tool should be listed and when it shouldn’t, could the same be worked out for the CK Editor? 

Lessons is getting an update ( [https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-49560|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-49560|smart-link] ). Could it be smart enough to recognize when a stealthed tool has been added to a site?

If the placements have been checked for navigation, and/or Lessons, and/or assignments, and/or the CK Editor, and the tool has been stealthed, I think the tools should be available for the instructor to use if the tool has been added to the site.

This was some *really great work* by some really smart developers around the world - but in the modern era, its time as an LMS feature has passed.  I shed a small tear when I seem how much talent and effort went into this - but ah well - time waits for no feature.

On a technical level, the last effort was 2015 and it has been commented out of the portal code since since 2022-10-27 because it was not “converted to trinity” and therefore not available at all in Sakai 23 and later.

It is my guess that this code is not running anywhere in production and thus can be deleted from Sakai 25.

If there are folks running this pre-trinity(23) and want it to run in trinity(23) - then a bunch of work needs to be done before Sakai 25.  I am guessing that a lot of it is just broken having not been tested for at least two years and likely more like almost 10 years.

This does not affect the Chat tool (left nav placed in sites) at all.  That will continue to work unchanged.","{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2024-06-12T20:25:37.000-0400"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""GitHub"":{""count"":1,""name"":""GitHub""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,"10/Jun/24 11:38 PM;557058:f58131cb-b67d-43c7-b30d-6b58d40bd077;A pull request has been created, ""SAK-50207 - Remove portal-chat, portal-video-chat, webrtc video from 25"", you can see it at https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/pull/12648",,Done,6/12/2024 20:25

But this issue was noticed while doing testing for those JIRAs.

Some classes have all quizzes available from day 1, to allow students to work ahead as they want. Those students could be getting a large number of very repetative emails all at once. This would be very annoying, and likely result in students deleting them all without reading, or changing to notification option to not receive these, even though it would be useful for classes that have the quiz open dates staggared throughout the class. 

Instead of an email for each quiz, can a single email be generated for all tests that open at a time for a site? The emails do not currently include the direct link to the quiz, just the site, so it could list all the quizzes that came available at the current time in the class, then have the link to the site below all of them.

(1) The Administrator’s Home Site (~admin) and the (2) The site where the actual administration is to be done (!admin).  One reason these are separate is that we can allow multiple users to administer the system without requiring sharing of the “admin” log in password. 

When we build a new feature (say Plus) that requires an Administration tool, we make sure to add that tool to the !admin site - and often the tool is written in such a way that it notices when it is in the !admin site and presents any admin-only UI elements.

Over the years, a number of “admin ui” tools have been added to the “~admin” and “!admin” sites, leading to confusion for new administrators as to what site to use for what purpose.

This Jira proposes to remove unnecessary duplicate tools from the “~admin” Home Site and rename that site to “Admin Home” to make things clearer.  There might be a few tools that we do leave as duplicate, perhaps to allow the “admin” user to repair something wrong in the “!admin” site (i.e. they were removed from the !admin realm by another administrator)  - or perhaps not - we can discuss the right way to do this.

The overall goal is to have the administration tools only in !admin and not in ~admin as much as possible to reduce confusion.

As a side note, this will only apply to initial server setup of fresh installs (i.e. on the nighties) - there will be no conversion script for this as the administrators of existing servers can (and probably have) tweaked the configurations of these sites to their liking - so not need to adjust the already existing sites.

This is an easy back merge to 23.x but it is probably fine to to just have this in master and 25.   I folks like it and want it in 23 make a comment.

*Note:* This does not have a database conversion and that is on purpose.   For existing systems, anyone can simply edit their ~admin site by hand to accomplish everything in this JIRA.  And if we tried to automate what happens in this Jira in a conversion script, it might unnecessarily step on local modifications that sites have already made in ~admin.","{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2024-06-06T19:11:30.000-0400"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""GitHub"":{""count"":1,""name"":""GitHub""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,"05/Jun/24 11:13 PM;557058:f58131cb-b67d-43c7-b30d-6b58d40bd077;A pull request has been created, ""SAK-50189 - Clean up ~admin tools for new installs"", you can see it at https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/pull/12642",,Done,6/6/2024 19:11

Apache FreeMarker™ is a template engine: a Java library to generate
text output (HTML web pages, e-mails, configuration files, source
code, etc.) based on templates and changing data. Templates are
written in the FreeMarker Template Language (FTL), which is a simple,
specialized language. Usually, a general-purpose programming language
(like Java) is used to prepare the data (issue database queries, do
business calculations). Then, Apache FreeMarker displays that prepared
data using templates. In the template you are focusing on how to
present the data, and outside the template you are focusing on what
data to present.","{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2024-06-04T09:04:58.000-0400"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""GitHub"":{""count"":1,""name"":""GitHub""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,"04/Jun/24 12:10 AM;557058:f58131cb-b67d-43c7-b30d-6b58d40bd077;A pull request has been created, ""SAK-50188 Update Apache FreeMarker 2.3.33"", you can see it at https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/pull/12639",,Done,6/4/2024 9:05

So we built these in anticipating of an emergent need that never emerged.  As a matter of fact they mostly broke over the years with no use and no testing.

Rather than expanding to fit the length of the text, when there are items in the checklist that are longer than can fit in half of the screen, they break to more than one line and the items look very awkward since they break to the line below the checkbox itself. Likewise, if there are items that are very short, there is a lot of empty space on the right, since it doesn’t shrink to fit the text. See image with examples below.

!checklist.png|width=91.66666666666667%,alt=""checklist.png""!

Ideally, the checkbox should automatically expand/shrink to best fit the text items included in it. And, if items must break to a second line, they should still keep the first line on the same row as the checkbox square. Obviously, if you place the checkbox into a column that is half width on the page, that will also limit the overall width of the checkbox and the items within it. However, it should not default to half page when placed in a full width section.  In addition, it would be nice if you had the option edit the item and specify the width of the checkbox manually, just in case the automatic sizing needs to be tweaked.

They seem to be added if a comment is added but only after the grading panel is closed (saved or ‘x’ clicked) and then reopened. The appearance of the ‘Remove’ link would be more intuitive if it displayed anytime its corresponding comment displays.

More importantly, after adding a Feedback Comment or Private Note, its corresponding ‘Remove’ link when clicked should display a confirmation prompt before proceeding with removing the content, similar to the confirmation for removing a rubric evaluation. Clicking this link accidentally without a confirmation prompt would lead to the frustrating experience of losing text. *The lack of a confirmation modal is why I’ve marked this jira as Critical.*

Also, when the comment is removed, the “Removed” notice does not disappear when editing the comment.

Finally, if removing the comment by deleting all HTML via the Source view of the CKEditor without toggling back to the WYSIWYG view before clicking Done, the edit (removal) of the comment is not saved by clicking Done. (The removal of all content via the WYSIWYG view will currently save by clicking Done, as expected.)

*contra to op my finding is that the evaluations are visible to the student!*



After some investigation i found that a part of the problem is probably located in {{SakaiRubricStudentButton.js}} 

{noformat}releaseEvaluation() {

  let url = `/api/sites/${this.siteId}/rubric-evaluations/tools/${this.toolId}/items/${this.entityId}/evaluations/${this.evaluatedItemId}`;
  return fetch(url, { credentials: ""include"" })
  .then(r => {

    if (r.status === 200) {
      return r.json();
    }

    if (r.status !== 204) {
      throw new Error(`Network error while getting evaluation at ${url}`);
    }

    return null;
  })
  .then(async data => {
    const evaluation = data._embedded.evaluations[0];
    if (evaluation) {
      evaluation.status = 2;
      url = `/api/sites/${this.siteId}/rubric-evaluations/${evaluation.id}`;
      await fetch(url, {
        body: JSON.stringify(evaluation),
        credentials: ""include"",
        headers: { ""Content-Type"": ""application/json"" },
        method: ""PATCH"",
      })
      .then(r => {
        if (!r.ok) {
          throw new Error(""Failed to release evaluation"");
        }
      });
    }
  }){noformat}

The response object is expected to have the {{_embedded}} property containing the evaluation. But the api seems to produce plain json object containing the evaluation.

Another part of the problem is probably that the Patch call contains plain json object containing the evaluation:

{{ headers: { ""Content-Type"": ""application/json"" },}}

But the corresponding API endpoint does require {{application/json-patch+json}}.

It was introduced in [https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-47852|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-47852|smart-link].  There are two use cases to SakaiPlus.  The first use case is the “sakai.site” use case where an entire site is created and shown with full portal markup and navigation.   The second use case is the “single tool use case” where the parent LMS wants to include a tool like Conversations in an iframe inside the LMS.    The single tool use case has its own “portal” URL at “/plus” and its own portal which is a reduced version of the portal with no site or tool navigation.

Since that time, a great deal of QA testing scripts have been developed and used.   For the “sakai.site” use case, the problems that were identified were fixed relatively easily.  But the “single tool case” encountered a lot of small bugs - particularly since the portal eliminated iframes, the tools just assume they are embedded in “/portal” and at times mess around with the markup or generate absolute urls.  Fixing these would have required digging into a lot of tool code and having if-then-else code to do one thing in the normal “/portal” markup and something completely different in the “/plus” portal.

Further, as we have exposed SakaiPlus to potential customers - there seems to be no real interest in the “single tool use case” and it turns out to be both simple and useful to tweak the “sakai.site” use case to feature one tool.  As a matter of fact, this is how Dr. Chuck uses it in his courses at the University of Michigan.  All tools except the Lessons tool are hidden from the students in the left navigation, but tools like Gradebook, Site Info and the Plus tool itself are very useful (and actually essential) for the instructor to configure, run and explore the Sakai environment.

Also, while it initially worked with enough cookie tweaks - it is difficult to maintain the Sakai session cookie inside of an iframe and likely to get more complex as browsers further crack down on trackers.

So with all of this I will be removing support for the “single tool” use case for SakaiPlus for Sakai 25.  It is a bummer since 100’s of hours of developer work and QA efforts went into it - but it really havs no clear path forward toward a reliable implementation and with no real demand from the market - we are better served to improve the sakai.site and improve import/export/site copy - things that do make SakaiPlus more relevant in the market given what we have learned from potential adopters.

I have linked the JIRAs on the single tool that we identified - while the list seems short, at one point we just stopped QA testing because things broke so often.

Removing support for deep linking has a subtle side benefit when it comes to LTI Auto Provisioning.  When an endpoint supports both the deep link and resource link flows - it is often difficult to set up the messages section in the auto provision protocol.  By only supporting context launch, resource link launch and privacy launch (and not deep linking) it makes auto provisioning deterministic across platforms.

This patch also cleaned up and advanced the code for LTI Automatic Provisioning, handling the Context Launch and Site Navigation placement use case introduced in [https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-49540|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-49540|smart-link]

Hi Chuck,

Will any of this impact the Basic LTI support, particularly the Sakai Connector Portlet / Basic LTI Portlet that is used in uPortal?
These portlets I wrote ages ago essentially allow a single tool to be embedded in another portlet enabled platform.

I will admit I haven't been following the Sakai Plus work so apologies if this is completely unrelated.

Steve,

Always glad to hear from you.  The simple answer is that there will be no impact.  However, given how tool markup has evolved since we eliminated iframes, it is pretty likely that the old Connector would end up pretty unsatisfactory today - not the connector itself - just the tools once the connector placed them in an iframe.

Sakai Plus was a 100% fork of the connector at the beginning.  But I make a complete copy in the plus folder and then replaced about  80% of it.  The old connector was LTI 1.1 only and the new connector was LTI 1.3 only.   The way grades work in each so so different that there was very little value in trying to make anything common.  Lets the old connector embrace LTI 1.1 100% and let the new connector embrace LTI 1.3 100% and don’t confuse things trying to make one piece of code handle very divergent and conflicting grading architectures.

The said, if you look at the plus code, it will feel familiar.   Because I borrowed a lot from the LTI 1.1 connector.  It was pretty elegant and having working code to provision users, sites, and realms really accelerated my work to develop plus - so thanks for that.

Looking at BaseContentService before the change here there seemed to be some special code that preserved the original InputStream.

I think the problem is that this comes in as a {{FileInputStream}} and that doesn’t support the reset that tika probably tries and needs to do. 

So the original code did

{noformat}                    TikaInputStream buff = TikaInputStream.get(edit.streamContent());

Christina’s comment on the ability to allow users to choose which terms they see vs only displaying pinned sites data: students who accidentally unpin a site (they do it all the time) don't lose the Discussions/Messages count, grades, and other info for that site.

Also, the label of “Test” could easily be confused with a notification from Tests & Quizzes.

The stacktraces only seem to occur on the first load of the roster tool.

I created 2 different sites:

* Official site with 3 sections and 5 groups
* Manually-created site with 3 groups

When creating new wiki pages, only the official site gives the option to Display this page to selected Groups only, but it only lists sections, not the groups. The manually-created site with groups only doesn’t even display the option. In both cases there is a jquery error in the browser console.

It seems a includeLibrary call was lost when moving from s2u-22x to master. 

Regarding the group support, this feature only shows the groups where the current user is enrolled. I believe it was an original requirement but I wasn’t directly involved in the development, see [https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/pull/11998|https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/pull/11998|smart-link] .

The issue does not affect “official enrollments” that are provisioned using sections. However, some schools do not rely on provisioned sites, so this would be an issue for anyone that enrolls people without using the automatic section feature. It seems dangerous to let students unenroll themselves from their classes, since they might mistake that for dropping a course, or they could unenroll themselves and then not be able to rejoin, since the site isn't joinable. Interestingly, faculty users don't have the ability to select non-joinable, manually created sites for unjoining.

~context:~
Currently, in the grading view, you can easily review all student submissions +for the same task+.

From the Assignment by Student view, you can see submissions +from different tasks+, grouped by each student.
Each submission has a button to access the grading view. However, going back and forth multiple times can be a tedious process. 
__

This aims to speed up the workflow, at least for simple cases where teacher feedback isn’t needed, just the grade.
This is achieved by adding a second button that opens a modal, which contains a simplified grader.

The modal header includes the title and two buttons: one to access the full grader and another to close/cancel the action.
Then we find the grader webcomponent, but only its essential parts are being shown:

* User info
* Text submission from the student
* Uploaded files (which will be downloaded on click)
* The grade input
* Save buttons",{},,,,To Do,5/10/2024 5:03

So it is our estimate that Sakai is not impacted by this vulnerability and will upgrade the lib.

An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance. Whether this issue poses a vulnerability will be subject to the intended behavior of the application. For example, a search engine might intentionally provide redirects to arbitrary URLs.

The Sign Up tool should generate notifications when there are new events available for sign-up, or as reminders about events that a user has signed up for.

When you create a new event in Sign Up, you specify a date/time when signup for the event begins. This date should be used to generate a notification letting students know that they can begin signing up for that item. 

Also, the Sign Up tool sends out a number of different email notifications and reminders for upcoming events once you sign up for something. We should add Notifications within the browser, so that it isn’t reliant only upon email notifications.

See the screenshot below of the current Sign Up settings related to notifications highlighted in yellow. I’d like to see browser notifications added anywhere that there is an existing email notification option.

The Lessons tool should generate notifications when new content is available. 

Currently, the Lessons tool sends notifications when there are Comments or Replies to Comments on Lessons pages. However, since Lessons pages and items can also be selectively released by date or other criteria, it might be nice to also get a notification when there are new content items available for a user to access. Also, it would be a nice heads-up for students to know if the instructor adds a new module or unit to the course. 

We would probably want to limit the notifications by page. For example “Lessons: Week 5 is now available” would be fine, but you don’t want to receive separate notifications for 15 individual items all on the same “Week 5” page. ",{},,,,To Do,5/1/2024 16:09

The Gradebook tool should generate notifications when new grades are posted. Currently, the Assignments and Tests & Quizzes tools send notifications when an assignment or quiz is graded. However, if you have a manually added gradebook item, and you enter a score in the Gradebook for that item, there is no notification sent. Likewise, if you have a graded LTI item from Lessons, or a graded SCORM item from SCORM Player, there is no notification sent, since the score goes directly to the Gradebook tool. Students will likely have the expectation that all grades will generate notifications, regardless of which tool they are coming from. (I know I would expect that as a student.)

We would need to take care that students aren’t double-notified - from the tool of origin (e.g. Assignments, T&Q) and from Gradebook itself - for the same item.

The Drop Box tool should generate notifications for new activity.

Drop Box is similar to Resources, and I know that Resources Notifications were turned off intentionally, since the Resources tool tended to generate too many notifications that were not really useful for end users. However, the purpose of the Drop Box tool is different than Resources. It is intended as a file-sharing space for students and faculty. With that use case in mind, I think that notifications for Drop Box activity might be useful.  

As a student, I think it would be useful to get a notification telling me when my instructor has uploaded a file to my Drop Box. 

Likewise, as an instructor, if you are using Drop Box as an alternative to Assignments for collecting files from students, it would be useful to know when you have new student files awaiting your review. 

Additionally, if users did not want to receive Drop Box notifications, they could always turn off the notifications for that tool from Preferences. (See associated Jira for proposed Notification Preferences modifications.)",{},,,,To Do,5/1/2024 15:35

The Dashboard Tasks Widget should generate notifications for new tasks which are manually created by the user for their personal Tasks or by the instructor for a site Tasks.

Currently, the Dashboard shows Tasks that are automatically added when there is a new assignment, quiz, etc. so we don’t need to duplicate those items. However, if a user adds tasks manually, either within their own Tasks widget as a personal to-do item, or as the instructor adding a Task for the class within a course site, you would want those reminders to also generate Notifications. 

Similar to the Calendar tool, since Tasks are typically time-sensitive and tied to a deadline of some sort, you would want these notifications to be sent on a schedule selected by the user. See example screenshot from Google Calendar below:

The Calendar tool should generate notifications for new events. 

Ideally, the calendar notifications would happen on a schedule, where users can decide how many and how far in advance they receive notifications, similar to the way you can set this up in Google Calendar (see screenshot below from Google Calendar as an example). Perhaps something like this could be added to the Calendar tool and/or the Home > Preferences > Notifications page.

Since other site events, such as Assignments or Tests & Quizzes due dates often appear on the course Calendar, having the Calendar tool send event notifications is a great way to notify students about upcoming due dates. While Assignments and Tests & Quizzes tools do send notifications, I believe they only send them when a new item is created/published or graded, but not 10 minutes (or an hour, or some other increment) prior to the due date.",{},,,,To Do,5/1/2024 15:12

Currently, Notifications in Sakai (formerly “Bullhorns”) are only generated for Announcements, Assignments, Commons, Lessons Comments, Profile (Status and Connection updates or Profile Connection Messages), and Tests & Quizzes. However, there are a lot of other Sakai tools from which users would expect to receive notifications. In order for the Notifications tool to be really useful and widely adopted, it needs to meet user expectations in terms of comprehensive tool coverage. Otherwise, institutions may hesitate to use it, worrying that students could miss items that don’t generate notifications and then claim that they weren’t notified of the new item so they didn’t realize it had been assigned/sent/created.

I have created separate Jiras for the following tools, each of which should be added to the Notifications service so that they generate notification messages when there is new content or activity available.

As we go forward, I expect that Notifications will become more and more important to users, since they are closely tied with the PWA mobile development. Also, in addition to being a more modern way of notifying users about course activity (many of whom find email to be somewhat “old school”), there are also tentative plans for UI indicators (i.e. little red circles) next to tool names in the left navigation when there is new content or activity within a given tool. (See mockup below.) This would provide another way to let users know when there is new activity in their courses.

# Tests & Quizzes: the QTI archiving code removes spaces from attachment paths for unclear reasons here: [https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/blob/master/samigo/samigo-qti/src/java/org/sakaiproject/tool/assessment/qti/asi/Item.java#L519|https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/blob/master/samigo/samigo-qti/src/java/org/sakaiproject/tool/assessment/qti/asi/Item.java#L519|smart-link] perhaps spaces in paths may not be supported in that version of the QTI spec
# References to files in user workspaces (e.g. in HTML content) have the form /access/content/user/EID/somefile whereas they are archived with /access/content/user/ID/somefile. These may not be possible to resolve correctly if the user concerned is not part of the site being archived (otherwise it would require a full archive of the entire user base to map EID to ID).

To allow the archives to be internally consistent, the cleanest solution here is to change the paths of the resource ids in attachment.xml to match how they are referenced from tool archive files. This needs to be done in BaseContentService, which seems like it shouldn’t need to be concerned with this detail, but there doesn’t appear to be a cleaner solution without much larger code changes.","{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2024-05-06T10:37:47.000-0400"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""GitHub"":{""count"":1,""name"":""GitHub""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,"27/Apr/24 5:04 AM;557058:f58131cb-b67d-43c7-b30d-6b58d40bd077;A pull request has been created, ""SAK-50021 Special handling for attachment archiving"", you can see it at https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/pull/12553",,Done,5/6/2024 10:37

I did a quick search of Jira and found SAK-45039, which at first glance, appeared to have fixed the issue in 22.X and 21.X. However, after testing this issue myself in 22.X (MySQL 5.7 branch) and reading through SAK-47147, I don’t believe the issues that were originally reported were ever fixed, or something happened to cause a regression.

 

Beyond the mechanics, there are some terminology and logic tweaks that I believe could help improve the overall usability and understanding of the information being displayed within the “Grades” widget area for the Instructor view.

 

I have attached a MS Word document that contains more detail about the process I used during my testing, and specific observations made, but here are the key takeaways:

 

·         There are inconsistencies with how items that originate in the Gradebook, or items that get associated with existing Gradebook items are handled vs. assignments that are created/graded from within a source tool.

·         It might help to make  a distinction between “items” and “submissions” – or maybe more accurately, between “submissions,” “graded submissions,” and “ungraded submissions”

·         Perhaps the indicator should report two separate things – the number of submissions, and the number of submissions that still need to be graded.

·         It appears that the average score is calculated differently for Assessments completed/scored from within Tests & Quizzes, which appears to be averaging the scores of submissions that have been graded with completed submissions that have not been graded yet, treating these ungraded submissions as “0” scores??

·         Along those same lines, maybe the “average score” should be relabeled to “average score of submissions that have been graded” and the logic adjusted accordingly.",{},,"28/Apr/24 9:59 AM;557058:093e0ced-45f4-4932-853a-c54031e22f52;Linked [https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-45039|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-45039|smart-link] because the number of ungraded items not being correctly displayed was an issue in 22 and 21, and was fixed for those versions.",,To Do,4/23/2024 14:01

This is mainly because of several checks for each student against each assignment on the site - even all the student’s assignments collapsed. Also when expanding a student’s assignments there are always all assignments displayed, not just the assignments assigned to the students.

The proposed solution is to display all the sites students based on the view selection “Entire site” or a particular group. When a clicking on a student, that has no assignments assigned. there will be no entries shown.

Furthermore this will incorporate the usage of the datatables library with will allow client side search of all the visible table rows and sorting for student name and assignent title of (expanded) assignmets. The server side search will be removed in favor of the new one - the only drawback is that the search content will not be passed to the export (timetable), that is disabled by default.","{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=2}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":2,""lastUpdated"":""2024-06-18T11:07:33.000-0400"",""stateCount"":2,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""GitHub"":{""count"":2,""name"":""GitHub""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,"24/Apr/24 9:16 AM;557058:f58131cb-b67d-43c7-b30d-6b58d40bd077;A pull request has been created, ""Assignments Improve performance and UX of Assignments by student view "", you can see it at https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/pull/12539",,Done,6/3/2024 12:03

This happens when the number at about over 9.200 rows - for example with 100 students and assignments, because this happens when the number of cell (styles) exceeds 64.000. The issue seems to be, that styles applied to the cells are newly created for each cell instead of being re-used. The proposed fix would be to move the creation of the cell-style out of the loops that iterate over the rows/cells, and just reuse them when the cells are created.

The critical amount of data is a bit below 10.000 rows - (64000 styled cells). The issue happens due to an illegal number of style definitions on the excel file, due to the same style being created for each cell - the style is created and added to the style while looping through the entries. A proposed solution would be to move the creation of the style out of the loops and only add it to the cell within the loop. This should also improve performance on smaller data sets where the the download does not “blow up”.

The sakai property {{timesheet.sites.allowed=all}} should be set to be able to use the download on Assignments by students.

The T&L/UX group reviewed the Assignments status messages, as well as the UI, and we have come up with some proposed improvements for the student view. (See the above related Jira for changes proposed for the instructor view.)

The following changes are proposed:

* Remove the “Last Modified By” and “Modified Date” columns from the student view, since they provide no actionable information that is of interest to students.
* Add an “Assignment Status” column that is similar to the one in the instructor view of the assignment list. Students don’t see Draft assignments at all. However, it would be useful for students to know which assignments are Open, Overdue, Closed, or Not Open yet, since this information is not always apparent from the Open/Due dates, particularly if late submissions are accepted. 
* In the “Due Date” column, if a student has been given a different accept until date, as a result of a resubmission or an extension, the due date exception should appear in bold below the original due date. Many users have complained that students are not always aware of the new deadline when they are granted a resubmission or extension date, and this would be a way to surface that information for them.
* Change the “Status” column label to “Submission Status” to make it clear that this status is for the student’s submission, not for the assignment overall. This is also consistent with the labeling in the instructor view for the same status information.
* Add the “Submitted Date” column (which is currently available for instructors but not students). This will make it easier for students to tell at a glance when they have submitted.
** If there are multiple submissions/resubmissions, include a “View History” link to view the submission history for that assignment.
* Add a “Grade” column (again, similar to the one found in the instructor view of student submissions) so that students can tell at a glance what their grade is for any items that have been graded and released. 
** If there is a rubric associated with an assignment, the rubric icon should also appear in the Grade column next to the score.

See the mockup below illustrating the proposed changes.

Part of this confusion may be a result of combining the instructor and student statuses (which are separate items in the database) into a single column when viewed by instructors. The T&L/UX group reviewed the status messages, as well as the UI, and we have come up with some proposed improvements for the instructor view. (See [https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-49978|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-49978|smart-link]  for the proposed student view improvements.)

I’m attaching a mockup showing the following suggested changes:

* Rather than combining the instructor and student status messages into a single column as it is now, which seems to cause confusion, we would like to split the messages into two separate columns: “Submission Status” which displays the student submission status exactly as the student sees it, and “Review Status” which displays the instructor status for each submission. 
** Having two separate columns makes it more clear where the data comes from and what it means. It also allows sorting by column to group like statuses together.
*** Note that we would also like the current sort order to be preserved when entering the Grader view. I will open a separate Jira about that. 
** In the “Review Status” column - when a student submission is In Progress (meaning that there has been a draft saved) we would like the instructor status to be “Draft Submission” rather than “Ungraded” since there is no official submission yet
* The “Submitted Date” columns stays the same, with the addition of a “View History” link which appears if there is more than one submission and/or resubmissions for a given student. I would envision a modal or popup of some sort when this is selected which would display the submission history for that user.
* A new “Accept Until Date” column has been added. This column displays the default Accept Until Date for the assignment for all users, something which is not easily visible to the instructor without looking at the assignment Settings. However, if a student has been granted an extension or a different resubmission deadline, those exceptions will be in bold and red font, so that the instructor can easily see which students have been granted exceptions without having to view an individual student submission to locate that information. 
* The “Grade” and “Released” columns remain the same.
* The order of the columns has been modified to the following, from left to right: Submission Status, Submitted Date, Accept Until Date, Review Status, Grade, Released

While the release grades feature is useful when hand-grading assignments, it is much less useful in the case of LTI assignments which are graded automatically. In fact, the need to release the grades in order for students to see them in the gradebook adds an extra task for the instructor for auto-graded LTI assignments, since instructors must go in and release grades for each assignment. 

This is not the case in Lessons. When you add a graded or auto-graded LTI item on a Lessons page, it will send the grade immediately without the need to manually release grades. However, Lessons does not give you many of the other features that are part of Assignments, such as due dates, email notifications, reminders, calendar events, etc. which make using the Assignments tool preferable to using Lessons for LTI items.

I would like to propose that we add a “release grades automatically” option in the assignment settings screen for LTI assignments. The default behavior can remain as it is, with grades requiring release. However, having the option to automatically release scores when sent via LTI would be a nice time-saver when used with automatically graded LTI items. 

I’ve included a mockup below. Perhaps this new option could be grayed out or not shown at all for non-LTI assignments.

Ironically, some of the “older” tools in Sakai seem to be sized appropriately when viewed in mobile view, while several of the “newer” tools are the ones that don’t size correctly for the screen. 

I have gone through tool by tool for all of the core, unstealthed tools typically available in a course site. I will include screenshots of the problematic ones below. 

Note: For my testing and screenshots, I used Firefox’s Responsive Design View with the iPhone SE 2nd edition selected for the size profile (i.e. 375 x 667). I also spot checked with a few other device sizes for other common phones, but the main difference was in the length of the display, not in the width of the device. Newer models like iPhone 12/13 Pro (390 x 844) and Galaxy S20 (360 x 800) still experienced the same issues with content being cut off.

LTI 1.1 and 1.3 tools _should_ work and _both_ store and directly placed tools should work.  Now there  might be issues in functionality after the tool is placed - but this Jira can be closed as not a bug.

*Original (incorrect) filed as requested by Chuck.*

From previous testing, the point was made that only tools from the “store” (the picker) should be used for LTI assignments. If there are multiple lti tools on the server, (1.1 “store”, 1.3 “store”, individual 1.1 or 1.3 tools), the tools show up as available when trying to add an LTI assignment.

The fixes that were made seem to work for sighted testers who are using their keyboard, however, for screen reader users, when they navigate onto any of the “drag to reorder” icons, they are not able to get the “E” or “D” keys to work.

 

For reference, I attached a short video I created when retesting SAK-48580.



I tested this on trunk/master using six different screen reader/web browser combinations (JAWS+Chrome, JAWS+Firefox, JAWS+Edge, NVDA+Chrome, NVDA+Firefox, and NVDA+Edge) and I am observing the same behavior.

 

The one exception to the above, is that the JAWS screen reader has a special insert+3 pass through keyboard command that essentially nullifies/over-rides any keystrokes that the screen reader might be using, so if I navigate onto one of these “drag to reorder” icons, press insert+3 to activate the JAWS pass through command, then press “E” or “D”, I can get the Rubric item to reorder.

 

The problem is that this is not a very well known JAWS feature, and the novice screen reader user might not know to use this, plus I’m not aware of an equivalent option for other screen readers like NVDA.",{},,,,To Do,4/5/2024 11:53

Is this type of component used anywhere else in Sakai? I’ve always thought having a select all or some type of smart selector on Manage Tools would also have been nice to have.

Like for assignment it could have 3 options like “All”, “All Published”, “All Unpublished”. Just as a thought.

Inconsistency in the new Bulk Publish feature among tools,SAK-49925,67452,Bug,Open,SAK,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Major,,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Wilma Hodges,557058:89b0bd66-0f67-42a4-b388-c7dbb7ceaa2d,4/3/2024 13:07,4/4/2024 19:02,8/8/2024 1:36,,25.0 [Tentative],,,,Announcements,Assignments,"The new bulk publish option in Assignments, Announcements, and Tests & Quizzes is a very nice addition, but there is a lot of inconsistency in the way it works in the different tools. It would be a much better user experience if the tools behaved in a more consistent manner when using this feature. 

For example, in Assignments, you can now select several items and choose the Publish button below. Note that the buttons for Remove, Publish, and Unpublish are all in dark blue once one or more check boxes are selected. 

!2024-04-03_12-11-39.jpg|width=100%,alt=""2024-04-03_12-11-39.jpg""!

After clicking Publish, you get a confirmation screen showing you a table that lists the assignments to be published along with the due date. It also includes the Status (Open, Due, Closed) and the number of Submissions. I can see where the Status might be useful, but I’m not entirely sure why Submissions are shown here. I assume that information is more applicable when Unpublishing an assignment? It just seems a bit odd to include in this screen.

!2024-04-03_12-11-47.jpg|width=100%,alt=""2024-04-03_12-11-47.jpg""!

In the Announcements tool, you have a similar experience to Assignments, but there is an extra button. When you choose one or more draft Announcements, you get Remove, Publish, Unpublish, and Clear Selections buttons. Note that the Remove, Publish, and Unpublish buttons are dark blue, as they appear in Assignments. However, there is the extra Clear Selections buttons which does not appear in Assignments and which I think would be useful in other tools where this bulk feature appears. 

!2024-04-03_12-39-50.jpg|width=91.66666666666667%,alt=""2024-04-03_12-39-50.jpg""!

Announcements, like Assignments, also provides you with a confirmation screen showing a table with the announcement information.

!2024-04-03_13-08-22.jpg|width=91.66666666666666%,alt=""2024-04-03_13-08-22.jpg""!

Now, in contrast, when you go to Test & Quizzes and use the Bulk Publish feature, you also get a Select check box to choose the items you want to Publish. Note that here, the buttons for Remove and Publish are not dark blue, they are the default gray color when enabled. These should be a consistent dark blue color in both tools for the Remove and Publish buttons. Also, there is no Unpublish or Clear Selections buttons shown here. I understand why the Unpublish button might be problematic, given the way that T&Q handles draft and published items as separate entities. However, it does present additional inconsistency in the UI. Perhaps a Retract button could be added in place of Unpublish? In any case, a Clear Selections button would be useful here. 

!2024-04-03_12-34-38.jpg|width=100%,alt=""2024-04-03_12-34-38.jpg""!

Upon clicking Publish in T&Q, instead of a table showing assessment information, as is shown in Assignments and Announcements, you just get a pop-up message asking for confirmation. 

!2024-04-03_12-12-37.jpg|width=542,height=171,alt=""2024-04-03_12-12-37.jpg""!

This pop-up does not provide the same level of information as is displayed in the other two tools. In addition, the option to add assessment due dates to the Calendar is typically displayed to the instructor in the publish screen on an individual quiz. If you bulk publish, there is no way to check the box to add the due date to the Calendar. Unlike Assignments, you can’t go into the Settings to select that box after publishing, since it doesn’t appear there. (See the related Jira requesting that the publish to calendar check box be added to assessment Settings. [https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/issues/SAK-38306|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/issues/SAK-38306] )

It would be far more preferable for T&Q to display a table with the assessment information, and this would also provide the opportunity to include a column containing the option to send the due date to the Calendar. See mockup below.

If an instructor wants to edit a tool title in “Tool Order” and the desired new tool name includes “u“ or “d“ the order is changed but the letter is not recognized as title.  The tool is always moved down the list.  I  think that “u“ is supposed to move the tool up and “d“ to move the tool down.This works if the tool is selected via tabulator.

* Go to “Site Info“ → “Tool Order” → Take one Tool and “Edit Tool Title“
* Click into the field (any area) 
* Try to edit the Tool Title typing a “u“ or “d“

Prompt user to designate a name for the new item when duplicating an assignment or assessment,SAK-49893,67421,Feature Request,Open,SAK,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Major,,,,Wilma Hodges,557058:89b0bd66-0f67-42a4-b388-c7dbb7ceaa2d,3/26/2024 16:10,8/7/2024 12:14,8/8/2024 1:36,,25.0 [Tentative],,,,Assignments,Tests & Quizzes (Samigo),"I recently noticed that the user experience is quite different when you duplicate items in different tools within Sakai. I think Assignments and Tests & Quizzes could benefit by being more consistent with the way that Discussions duplicates items. Let me explain.

In Discussions, when you duplicate a forum or topic, you are presented with a screen like the one below, where you have the option to rename the item before confirming duplication.

!2024-03-26_15-49-19.png|width=91.66666666666666%!

However, when you duplicate an assessment in Tests & Quizzes, you get a confirmation screen, but there is no option to rename the copy. 

!2024-03-26_15-46-39.png|width=91.66666666666666%!

This is annoying because it auto-names the duplicated item with “- Copy #1” at the end of the title. So, then you have to immediately go to the item Settings, expand the About section, change the title, and then Save. That’s a lot of extra steps to change the auto-created name, when it would be much more efficient to simply present the user with a screen similar to the one in Discussions, and let them have the option to rename the item prior to duplication. (See mockup below)

!2024-03-26_16-05-54.png|width=100%!

In Assignments, it doesn’t ask you to confirm the duplication at all. Clicking on the “Duplicate” link below an existing assignment immediately creates a Draft assignment with “- Copy” appended to the title. 

!2024-03-26_15-50-07.png|width=91.66666666666667%!

As with Tests & Quizzes, the user then has to Edit the assignment, change the title in the Settings, and Save. Several extra steps which could be avoided if they were allowed to specify the name of the copy upon duplication. 

It would be much better if all three tools had a similar workflow for duplication, so that the user experience across tools is more predictable.",{},,"07/Aug/24 12:14 PM;557058:89b0bd66-0f67-42a4-b388-c7dbb7ceaa2d;We talked about this on the T&L/UX call today. We liked the idea of more consistency across tools, and having the combined “Are you sure you want to duplicate?” message on the same screen as the option to rename the item title. We also thought that perhaps it might be helpful to have some additional options on that screen, instead of only the Duplicate button, to simplify the workflow. In many cases, the instructor might want to go in and edit the settings (or in the case of an assessment, the questions) as the next action, so it would save steps for the instructor if they have a few different options on the next page upon duplicate. For example: 

* Duplicate and Return

Create a Sakai Course Export with the same fidelity as Site Import when imported into another Sakai instance,SAK-49892,67420,Feature Request,Open,SAK,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Major,,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Wilma Hodges,557058:89b0bd66-0f67-42a4-b388-c7dbb7ceaa2d,3/26/2024 15:26,3/28/2024 18:45,8/8/2024 1:36,,25.0 [Tentative],,,,Common Cartridge,Site Archive (Admin),"Currently, if you need to move a Sakai site from one instance of Sakai to a new instance, it is very difficult to accomplish and usually requires a lot of manual work. While it is possible to export the course in IMS CC format, that format results in an incompletely imported site which requires a lot of cleanup. Likewise, the Sakai site archive format (which is only readily available for admin users) is also incomplete and requires a lot of manual cleanup and/or tweaking after the import. Many of the tools and content elements in Sakai are Sakai-specific and have no specification in the IMS CC format (for example, Lessons section layouts, checklists, or in-line questions; Dashboard tool content and widget settings; etc.). In addition, some of the items which are in the IMS CC spec, are not configured in such a way to make for a good user experience - for example, the handling of Resources where lots and lots of folders and files with indecipherable names are created. 

I would like to propose that we create a new type of Sakai export that is Sakai-specific and which includes the following features:

# More detailed information about the configuration and use of Sakai tools so that the content, once imported, provides a complete and fully optimized copy of the original site. Ideally, this type of Sakai export or archive would provide the same level of site fidelity that you get when you do an “Import from Site” to copy from one site to another on the same instance. However, this export would allow you to copy a site to another server. 
# Individual instructors should be able to create and download this export for their own sites.
# Admins should also be able to export multiple courses (or select a term at a time) to do bulk exports and downloads on demand as well as on a specified schedule.

With the advent of Sakai Plus and the desire to use Sakai as a potential publishing tool for distributing content via LTI, the use case of moving an entire course from one instance of Sakai to another is likely to become more common. Additionally, the ability to export a high fidelity course archive would also make it easier for institutions to back up and remove older sites from the production server and still maintain access to an easy-to-restore version of the site. 

Incidentally, it is not uncommon for LMS’s to have an LMS-specific export as an option in addition to an IMS CC option. Brightspace and Moodle both do this. ",{},,,,To Do,3/26/2024 15:26

There is a good use case for allowing the instructor to duplicate question(s) in the current pool. If they are creating a set of questions that follow a common theme, it is much faster to copy a question then edit then to create a new one with the same text and answer options.

Also, this limitation against duplicate questions only protects against copying a question into it’s existing pool. An instructor can create a copy in a temporary pool, then copy it from the temp pool back to the main pool. It doesn’t check to make sure they don’t manually create two identical questions. Instructors can copy questions from a test part into a question pool multiple times, creating duplicate sets.

* PLATFORM: Initial JDK22 support added.
* PLAFTORM Added support for Eclipse 2024-03. [Issue #3620|https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/3620].
* PLATFORM: Added support for recent versions of eclipse (released Q4 2023 or later or so) which would cause failures in the eclipse logs such as {{java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 'java.lang.StringBuffer org.eclipse.jdt…}}. [Issue #3564|https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/3564].
* FEATURE: {{@Locked}} has been introduced. Like {{@Synchronized}} but with {{java.util.concurrent.locks}} locks instead of the {{synchronized}} primitive. Thanks, Pim van der Loos for the PR! [Issue #3506|https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/3506].
* NECROMANCY: Inlining a generated getter in eclipse would result in eclipse incorrectly replacing calls with {{@Getter}} instead of the actual field's name. [Issue #562|https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/562]. This issue is almost old enough to drink. Points for dedication go to Rawi for fixing this one.
* BUGFIX: When {{@SuperBuilder}} was used on a type with an annotated generic type, it would error {{wrong number of type arguments}}. [Issue #3592|https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/3592].
* BUGFIX: It was possible to create an infinite build loop using {{@ExtensionMethod}}. [Issue #3225|https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/3225].
* BUGFIX: Using {{@Getter(lazy=true)}} would fail if the expression contained a variable called {{value}}. [Issue #2917|https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/2917].
* BUGFIX: Many lombok features wouldn't work properly on records contained within an outer type unless you explicitly marked it {{static}}. [Issue #3497|https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/3497] [Issue #3559|https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/3559].
* BUGFIX: Eclipse projects using the {{com.pro-crafting.tools:jasperreports-plugin}} will now compile.
* BUGFIX: {{@FieldNameConstants}} now works when generated fields are involved. [Issue #3529|https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/3529].

In short, while the *submission history* and *submission timestamps* are viewable in the Assignments “legacy” grader, this needed functionality is still missing in the “new” grader. This missing functionality is causing some confusion at our institution.

For instance: Assume an instructor creates an assignment and wishes to allow a student multiple resubmission attempts to track a student’s progress. If a student uploads and submits, and then later – without removing the original submission – the student uploads and submits an attachment with the same naming convention, then the instructor has no way to discern the most recent submission in the “new” Grader. This issue gets even more challenging as the student resubmits more and more.

What happens is that the database table SAM_PUBLISHEDACCESSCONTROL_T.releaseto column is set to the original site title, but after the site tile is changed, that column remains as the old title.  Then it seems that samigo can’t find a matching title in releaseto so it changes the availability to “Anyone with link”.

{noformat}// deal with releaseTo
this.releaseTo = accessControl.getReleaseTo(); // list of String
this.publishingTargets = getPublishingTargets();
this.targetSelected = getTargetSelected(releaseTo);
this.firstTargetSelected = getFirstTargetSelected(releaseTo);{noformat}

firstTargetSelected gets set to the releaseTo value of SAM_PUBLISHEDACCESSCONTROL_T.releaseto, which is the “old” site title

then in the same java file’s *getPublishingTargets()* method, it sets up the Availability dropdown to use the new site title

so then in *publishedSettings.jsp*

{noformat}<h:selectOneMenu id=""releaseTo"" disabled=""true"" value=""#{publishedSettings.firstTargetSelected}"" onclick=""setBlockDivs();"">{noformat}

it tries to set the selected option to the firstTargetSelected, which is the “old” title, but since no options exist with that value, it defaults to the 1st and wrong option.

perhaps instead of setting SAM_PUBLISHEDACCESSCONTROL_T.releaseto to the site title, it should be set to “Entire Site” (or “entire_site”) or the site_id.  And the Availability dropdown value for “should match either “Entire Site” or the site_id.  Or is there another reason the releaseTo is set to the title?  But also , this would affect many records in SAM_PUBLISHEDACCESSCONTROL_T, so you’d have to account for “Entire Site” or “title”…. or write a databaese conversion script to change all of the “titles” to “Entire Site” (where releaseTo != “Anonymous User” and releaseTo != “Selected Groups” and releaseTo != '')",,To Do,3/8/2024 17:30

However, it is confusing to see the “inline submission” link (which does not go anywhere) when there is no draft at all. Furthermore, the inline submission link for student with no submission is visible prior to the due date for the assignment, which I don’t think was the intent with the above Jira. 

For example, currently on the nightly server, if you create an assignment, and then immediately select Grade before the due date and before any students have started the assignment, you will see the inline submission link within the empty student submission screen.

It seems to me that the “inline submission” link should not appear at all for students who have never started the assignment or saved a draft.

This causes that when an instructor loads the ""View Submissions"" page in Assignments every non stored report is requested to Urkund's API, so in assignments with a large number of submissions this mades the page to load very slowly.

Assignments > Allow Extension Redesign,SAK-49792,67319,Improvement,Open,SAK,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Critical,,Earle Nietzel,557058:d4bf1967-6188-4b29-bf4a-95cf874b4a08,John Buckingham,70121:fbb7b515-e767-4033-9ad8-f4f033da3b40,2/27/2024 14:02,7/3/2024 12:17,8/8/2024 1:36,,22.5,23.1,25.0 [Tentative],,Assignments,,"h2. *Description*

In the Assignments tool, instructors now have the option to allow an extension for a first-time submission. 

As [+SAK 49527+|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-49527] shares, this functionality only works if the instructor clicks “Save and Release to Student” in either the new or legacy grader. If an instructor clicks either “Save and Don’t Release to Student” (in the legacy grader) or “Save” (in the new grader), then the extension does not work. 

The current design and behavior can be confusing for faculty members for several reasons:

# If the instructor clicks “Save and Don’t Release to Student” (in legacy grader) or “Save” (in new grader), and then navigates back to the student’s assignment submission page, the checkbox for “Allow Extension” is checked, which can give the instructor a false sense of security that the extension was granted. In addition, there is no error or helpful guidance given to the instructor that they clicked the wrong button.
# Requiring an instructor to click “Save and Release to Student” (in either the legacy or new grader) to grant an extension is not intuitive, as instructors have historically approached this button with great caution (not wanting to release grades until ready). When granting an extension, instructors are presumably not seeking to “release” any feedback to the student, because nothing has been submitted. So it does not make sense from a user perspective to have to “release” anything to grant an assignment extension.
# In both the legacy and new grader, the placement of the “Allow Extension” functionality is all the way down at the bottom of the student submission page. From a logical perspective, placing this functionality _after_ all of the grading/feedback fields is not intuitive. While it makes intuitive sense to place the “Allow Resubmission” function there (as an instructor may wish to allow a student to resubmit an assignment that needs additional work), allowing an extension for a first time submission should precede the grading area.

h2. Proposal

h3. Legacy Grader

In the legacy grader, place the “Allow Extension” functionality closer to the submission status. This way, an extension is not located near the grading area and is logically connected to a submission status of “No Submission.”

In addition, place a “Save” button in close proximity to the “Allow Extension” checkbox and date. This “Save” button only governs the extension functionality, and does not include any language about “releasing” anything.

In addition, when a student has already submitted, this functionality should no longer feature. At this point, an instructor must allow resubmission, which is located at the bottom of the page.

h3. New Grader

In the new grader, the “Allow Extension” functionality can be placed above the grading/feedback options (see screenshot below).

h3. Confirmation Messages

Lastly, in both the legacy grader and the new grader, whenever an instructor saves an extension, a confirmation message should be displayed to confirm the save to the user. This is important for digital accessibility.

This is caused by some kind of “wrong ordering” of criterions and ratings being stored in database (i.e. 0 - 1 - 3 with 2 missing). They’re both loaded/stored using a Spring tag (OrderColumn).

When this is the case the method getRubricsForSite from RubricsService throws an exception and it has a few side effects:

* Rubrics tool doesn’t load any Rubric.
* Same with other tools trying to associate rubrics.
* Transfer of assessments between sites also fails because it loads the site rubrics before doing anything else (see SAK-49436)

Issue

After applying 22.4 to our production system, we noticed that “admin” users can no longer see any user photos in the Roster tool, including official photos.

By default, an “admin” user is a super-user who should inherit the same permissions as an Instructor or Maintain user without any extra effort. Also, it is not desirable in all situations to manually enroll an admin user as an “Instructor” to troubleshoot site issues.

What changed in 22.4? How can the admin role (which isn’t a formal “role” for class sites or project sites) have the appropriate, top-level permissions for Roster (and any tool, frankly).","{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2024-02-21T08:05:07.000-0500"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""GitHub"":{""count"":1,""name"":""GitHub""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,20/Feb/24 12:24 PM;557058:48227012-f9a6-40a4-97e6-94c8ef57f33e;Seems caused by SAK-48657,,Done,2/21/2024 8:05

In this case, the Gradebook won’t even start up enough to change/fix the grade type.  This change makes it so that if one way or another a grade type of UNKNOWN is encountered it is Mapped to POINTS.

If the gradebook is of GradeType unknown you will get the following traceback as soon as the Gradebook tool is launched:

Basically, while the “Notifications” panel/modal is expanded, selecting/activating either of the aforementioned buttons will result in the page refreshing, and focus moving outside of the modal (which remains displayed in the foreground) and jumping to the title area of the page, essentially trapping the cursor in the content of the main page (which is in the background/greyed-out portion of the screen.)

 

When this happens, screen reader users have to navigate through the entire page, past the contents of the footer, until they can move focus back into the still expanded “Notifications” panel, where selecting/activating the “Close this notifications panel” button is their only option (the escape key doesn’t work when this weird modal focus issue is being observed) for closing out the modal and returning focus to the user’s home page.",{},,,,To Do,2/12/2024 20:21

Since the purpose of the “Marked all as viewed” button is to remove the “red circle” graphic, as an easy, convenient way for users to keep up on their new alerts/manage the contents of their “Notifications” panel, the fact that this visual indicator is not screen reader compatible is rendering the “Marked all as viewed” feature inaccessible as well.

 

Sighted users can go through and read all of their alerts, then select the “Marked all as viewed” button to remove the “red circle” graphic, so  any subsequent times   they log into the system and see the “red circle” graphic, they’ll immediately know that they have new alerts waiting for them.

I tested this out on 23.X (Maria DB branch) using JAWS+Chrome and NVDA+Chrome and it doesn’t work with either of these combinations, and I suspect it won’t work with other screen reader/web browser combinations either.

 

The impact of this is two-fold:

 

1—It doesn’t provide for an easy, convenient way (i.e. viewable from the top navigation of the user’s home page) for screen reader users to tell whether there are new alerts waiting for them.

 

Instead, they have to select/activate the “View your notifications” button to manually check whether there are any new alerts, which defeats the purpose of having this sort of indicator in the top navigation.

 

2—Similarly, the inaccessible “red circle” graphic makes the “Mark all as viewed” feature inaccessible as well, because the main purpose of this feature is to remove the “red circle” graphic from next to the (View your notifications” (bell) icon in the top navigation (after the user has gone through and viewed all of their alerts) so the next time they navigate back to their home page, they don’t have to open the “Notifications” panel to check whether there are any new alerts.",{},,,,To Do,2/12/2024 17:44

So 17.75 becomes 177.5. Classic Grader correctly warns instructors that they must enter a score with a maximum of one decimal place.

In most circumstances, Assignments allows scores to have two decimal points. However, very old versions of Sakai allowed just one decimal point.

Update UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java 6.0.11,SAK-49720,67247,Bug,Closed,SAK,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Major,Fixed,David Horwitz,557058:e67144fb-5a8e-4eca-b536-d02ecff9f6cc,David Horwitz,557058:e67144fb-5a8e-4eca-b536-d02ecff9f6cc,2/6/2024 22:41,7/25/2024 23:48,8/8/2024 1:36,2/7/2024 2:18,20.5,,,,Providers,,"We have just released version 6.0.11 of the [+UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java+|https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk]. It is available for download from [+GitHub+|https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/releases] and [+SourceForge+|https://sourceforge.net/projects/ldap-sdk/files/], and it is available in the [+Maven Central Repository+|https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.unboundid/unboundid-ldapsdk/6.0.11].

Note that this is the last release of the LDAP SDK that will offer support for Java 7. As of the next release (which is expected to have a version of 7.0.0), the LDAP SDK will only support Java 8 and later.

You can find the release notes for the 6.0.11 release (and all previous versions) at [+https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/release-notes.html+|https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/release-notes.html], but here’s a summary of the changes:

* We updated the {{ldapsearch}} and {{ldapmodify}} command-line tools to provide better validation for the {{--proxyAs}} argument, which includes the proxied authorization v2 request control in the requests that they issue. Previously, they would accept any string as the authorization ID value, but they will verify that it is a valid authorization ID using the form “dn:” followed by a valid DN or “u:” followed by a username.
* We updated the {{Filter}} class so that the methods used to create substring filters are more user-friendly when the filter doesn’t contain all types of components. Previously, it expected a substring component to be null if that component wasn’t to be included in the request, and it would create an invalid filter if the component was provided as an empty string. It will now treat components provided as empty strings as if they had been null.
* We updated the logic that the LDAP SDK uses to pare entries down to a specified set of attributes (including in the in-memory directory server and the {{ldifsearch}} command-line tool) to improve its behavior if it encounters an entry with a malformed attribute description (for example, one that contains characters that aren’t allowed). Previously, this would result in an internal error, but it will now make a best-attempt effort to handle the invalid name.
* We updated the {{TimestampArgument}} class to allow it to accept timestamps in the ISO 8601 format described in RFC 3339 (e.g., 2023-11-30T01:02:03.456Z). Previously, it only accepted timestamps in the generalized time format (or a generalized time representation that didn’t include any time zone information, which was treated as the system’s local time zone).
* We updated the {{JSONBuffer}} class to add an {{appendField}} method that can be used to append a generic field without knowing the value type. Previously, it only allowed you to append fields if you knew the type of the value.
* We added new {{BinarySizeUnit}} and {{DecimalSizeUnit}} enums that can be used when dealing with a quantity of data, like the size of a file or the amount of information transferred over a network. Each of the enums supports a variety of units (bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, petabytes, exabytes, zettabytes, and yottabytes), but the {{BinarySizeUnit}} variant assumes that each subsequent unit is 1024 times greater than the previous (e.g., one kilobyte is treated as 1024 bytes), while {{DecimalSizeUnit}} assumes that each subsequent unit is 1000 times greater than the previous (e.g., one kilobyte is treated as 1000 bytes).
* We updated the client-side support for invoking the LDIF export administrative task in the Ping Identity Directory Server to include support for activating one or more post-LDIF-export task processors, which can be used to perform additional processing after the data is successfully exported.","{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2024-02-07T02:18:36.000-0500"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""GitHub"":{""count"":1,""name"":""GitHub""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,"06/Feb/24 10:48 PM;557058:f58131cb-b67d-43c7-b30d-6b58d40bd077;A pull request has been created, ""SAK-49720 Update UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java 6.0.11"", you can see it at https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/pull/12351",,Done,2/7/2024 2:18

"Issues related to new ""Lessons: View items based on a grade"" feature",SAK-49705,67232,Bug,Open,SAK,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Major,,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Wilma Hodges,557058:89b0bd66-0f67-42a4-b388-c7dbb7ceaa2d,1/31/2024 13:49,2/2/2024 10:17,8/8/2024 1:36,,25.0 [Tentative],,,,Lessons,,"I was super excited to test out the new feature contributed by S2U/EDF [https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/S2U-35|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/S2U-35|smart-link]  While I do think it is a big improvement to have more flexibility in defining access criteria in a non-linear way, I’ve noticed several issues with the feature that I think will be very confusing for end users.  

# The new condition creation option only seems to work for links to Assignments or Tests & Quizzes items. In the S2U-35 Jira, the description said that it would apply to Lessons question items as well, but this is not the case. I tried to create a condition for an in-line Lessons question but the option is not there.
# It is confusing that only some item types can use this option, since it isn’t clear to users which ones are available for creating conditions. It doesn’t even work with all items that are gradable in Lessons, as in-line questions and Student Content don’t have the feature. I also could see someone wanting to create a condition for other types of graded items, such as Discussion links. I have another Jira open about adding the ability to also use Gradebook items and categories. [https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-49623|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-49623|smart-link] All of those things would seem to be needed as grade-related conditions, so it seems odd and very limiting that only a couple of item types are supported. If one doesn’t understand the limitations, the inclination is to assume the feature is broken.
# The new condition-based release seems to operate completely independently of the existing Lessons prerequisite and required item options. Again, it is very unclear to users which option should be used in which situations. When I began testing the feature, I assumed that the “require this item” checkbox was needed in order to create a condition based on an item. In fact, it is not. Neither is the “Don't Release Item Until All Prerequisites are Completed” needed in order to select a prerequisite condition for an item.  
# The two different requirement/condition features are particularly confusing for Assignment and Tests & Quizzes items, since both of those item types also have an option to specify “Require that the student receive ___ points” for that item to meet the requirement. It would be easy to assume that this is duplicate functionality, but due to the differences in how the two features work, it actually isn’t redundant, but it could easily be perceived as such. Again, this makes the user wonder which option they should use and what the difference is between them.
# Unlike the existing Lessons requirement/prereq functionality, with the new conditions feature there are no visual cues on the item when viewed on the Lessons page to indicate that there is a condition associated with an item, or a prerequisite condition for release of an item. In existing Lessons, items that had prereqs had the text _[Has prerequisites]_ included after the title of the item. However, items with conditions do not have anything added. You have to edit the item and select to open and view the Prerequisites and Requirements section to see if there are any conditions associated with an item. 
# It seems counterintuitive that you have to first create the condition by editing the required item, before it becomes available for selection as a condition for a different item. In practice, this makes for a lot of back and forth if you haven’t planned ahead carefully. For example, if I want the “Week 2” page to require a score of 80 on the “Week 1 Quiz” , I can’t just go to “Week 2” and set that as a condition (i.e. prereq) for access. I have to first go to “Week 1 Quiz”, create the condition, then return to “Week 2” and select it as a requirement. It would be much more intuitive if a user could simply go to the page where they want to specify a prerequisite condition, and on that page they would have the option to select from all existing graded items (i.e. assignments, quizzes, gradebook, etc.) and create a new condition. 

I know that the development of this feature was part of the S2U Unidigital project, but I’m uncertain if there are additional extensions or enhancements currently planned.

Awkward student workflow for submitting LTI assignments that open in new window,SAK-49698,67225,Bug,Open,SAK,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Major,,,,Wilma Hodges,557058:89b0bd66-0f67-42a4-b388-c7dbb7ceaa2d,1/30/2024 12:37,2/2/2024 10:24,8/8/2024 1:36,,22.4,23,23.1,,Assignments,LTI,"The issue related to the awkward workflow for students when submitting LTI assignments via the Assignment tool was first raised in [https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-45900|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-45900|smart-link]. However, that Jira also included information about the submission status message for LTI assignments, so it was marked as resolved when the status information was fixed, but the UI issue about the workflow was never completely addressed.

There is a redundant step in the process which creates an additional click for the student. When the student clicks on the assignment, it does not take the student right to the external tool. It takes them to the screen below and then the student has to click the “Go to External Tool” button to actually see the assignment. 

!lti-assignment-click1.png|width=91.66666666666667%!

If the instructor has selected to open the tool in a new tab, there is another step is needed. When the student clicks “Go to External Tool” it still does not take the student to the tool, instead, it displays another page where the student then has to click “Launch External Tool in New Window”. 

!lti-assignment-click2.png|width=91.66666666666667%!

After clicking that button, then a new tab opens up where it loads the actual tool. 

!lti-assignment-click3.png|width=91.66666666666666%!

The “Launch External Tool in a New Window” page is redundant and just makes more clicks for the user. They have to click once on the Assignment link within the site to go to the assignment detail page; then twice to select “Go to external tool”; and then a third time to select “Launch tool in a new window” and actually get to the assignment itself. It would be better for the new tab to open up and show the tool directly upon clicking “Go to External Tool.”

Incidentally, if the instructor has NOT selected to open the external tool in a new tab, clicking on the “Go to External Tool” button does load the tool within the content frame. There is no extra screen with an extra click. The open in a new tab behavior should be consistent with the open in content frame behavior. ",{},,,,To Do,1/30/2024 12:37

Allow option to remove open/close dates from Assignments title in Lessons,SAK-49693,67220,Feature Request,Open,SAK,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Major,,,,Wilma Hodges,557058:89b0bd66-0f67-42a4-b388-c7dbb7ceaa2d,1/29/2024 16:26,7/18/2024 19:24,8/8/2024 1:36,,22.4,23,23.1,,Assignments,Lessons,"In Lessons, when you add a link to an Assignment on a Lessons page, it automatically includes the open and due dates at the end of the title. However, in some cases, the instructor may not want all that extra text in the  assignment title. Unfortunately, it cannot be removed. Editing the title of the item on the page and removing the open/due text does nothing. The dates are automatically re-inserted into the title upon Save. 

While I understand the reasoning behind including the dates by default (it is generally a good idea to let students know when things are open/due), it is a bit frustrating that the instructor isn’t allowed to remove that text. There are several reasons why an instructor might not want to include the open/due date information in brackets at the end of the title:

# Assignments does this in Lessons, but Tests & Quizzes, Discussions, and other dated items do not. This inconsistency is confusing to the user.
# The addition of +[Open on: Jan 29, 2024, 4:04:00 PM] [Due on: Feb 5, 2024, 4:04:00 PM]+ at the end of the assignment title is not very attractive. This long string of text in the title may make the Assignment links appear awkward or crowded on the page depending upon the page layout. It creates visual clutter to have very long titles.
# If the due date is hidden from students, they will see this instead  +[Open on: Jan 29, 2024, 4:04:00 PM] [Due on: -]+ which seems a bit misleading, since there is a due date, but it isn’t being shown. Wouldn’t it be better to just omit the “Due on” part, rather than show “Due on: -”.
# In another Jira [https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-49692|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-49692|smart-link] I have proposed a feature request to allow assignments without a due date, similar to the way that Tests & Quizzes can have no due date. The option to not have an end date better supports a self-paced learning or open-access course design. If there is no end date, then the “Due on: -” is also unnecessary.

Perhaps there could be an option when you edit the item in Lessons to display the open and/or end date in the Item Description area, instead of as part of the title. Both options could be selected by default, but this would allow instructors to de-select one or both dates if desired. 

See mockup below:

!include-open-due-dates-option.png|width=100%!

Also, I think that placing that information in the Description field would look a little better, since the link would not be such a long string and users are more accustomed to seeing more text in a description field rather than a title.

However, sometimes there are assignments which don’t really need an end date. I often find myself creating assignments and then setting an end date very far in the future (like one or two years in the future) just because I want them to be essentially open-ended. This is particularly true when setting up a self-paced style course, where things are set to be released upon completion of items in a particular sequence, rather than depending on specific open and close dates on a calendar.

The Tests & Quizzes tool allows instructors to create assessments without an end date. It seems odd that the Assignments tool does not. 

Allowing the option to specify an open end date (i.e. no end date) for Assignments would improve consistency across tools, would be more user-friendly for instructors with open-access assignments, and would be more in keeping with the behavior of other competitor LMS Assignment options, especially in the case of self-paced learning environments.

It is quite common for instructors to purposely hide some tools (Resources, or Assignments for example), if they prefer for students to access the course content via Lessons, rather than jumping to various tools directly. However, after importing site content, instructors with hidden tools then have to go back to Site Info > Tool Order and re-hide (or re-lock) all of the hidden/locked tools that were copied. This makes for an unnecessary second step each time a site is imported. 

It would be a much better user experience if all imported tools maintained the same hidden/locked status from the site being copied, so that instructors don’t have to waste time re-setting tool visibility after import.

I expected that I would not see the tools in the left nav if I did not have the correct permissions to view them. However, the tools in Sakai seem to behave differently depending on the tool. Some of them respect the permissions (or lack thereof) and others don’t. 

The following tools DO NOT appear in the left nav, as I expected. This behavior makes sense.

* Announcements
* Calendar
* Chat Room
* Dropbox
* Email
* Email Archive
* Podcasts
* Wiki

The following tools DO show up in the left nav, but they display an error message related to not having the correct permissions. This is better than showing content which should be hidden, but still not ideal. It would be better not to see the tool at all if you don’t have access to it.

* Commons
* Gradebook
* Lessons
* Section Info

These tools DO show up, and there is no error message. However, they also DO NOT display any content to the user. They appear as if there are no items in that tool (even when there are items available to the students in the site).

* Assignments
* Conversations
* Tests & Quizzes
* SignUp
* PostEm

The following tools DO show up in the left nav, and they also DO display content and/or allow the user to use the tool to post a message, view/print tool content, search, etc. - it varies depending on the nature of the tool. This does not make sense, as it seems more logical that they should not have access to these items if they have no permissions other than site.visit.

I believe we need a new property in the sakai.properties file to allow institutions to set the default publish behavior for their institution. 

The preferred behavior depends on the institution’s normal workflow for publishing sites. Some institutions automate everything, and others leave it up to individual faculty to publish. Therefore, some institutions may prefer to default to auto, whereas others will want the default to be manual.

The suggested new property would be:

“site.setup.publish.default = auto | scheduled | manual”

with an OOTB default setting of:
”site.setup.publish.default=manual”

The “manual” setting is less likely to be disruptive to existing expectations, since it is more similar to the prior behavior.

More Granular Options for Importing Site Content,SAK-49673,67200,Feature Request,Open,SAK,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Major,,,,Wilma Hodges,557058:89b0bd66-0f67-42a4-b388-c7dbb7ceaa2d,1/24/2024 16:36,3/27/2024 16:30,8/8/2024 1:36,,23,23.1,25.0 [Tentative],,Assignments,Forums Tool,"Sakai users often request the ability to selectively import a subset of items from one site to another during the *Site Info > Import from Site* process. Currently, it is an all or nothing process for items within a tool. You either import all of the Lessons from a site, or none of them. The same is true of other tools containing multiple items, such as Assignments, Tests & Quizzes, Resources, Discussions, etc. 

In practice, this means that instructors or site owners are often forced to import everything from another site, when they really only wanted a handful of items. After importing everything, they then have to go through all of the content and delete the items they don’t want. This can be laborious, not to mention confusing, particularly if there are any similarly names items in both the copied site and the target site. 

There are some workarounds for bringing over individual items, such as exporting and importing individual quizzes from Tests & Quizzes, or using the newly added ability to copy a single Lessons page from another site (SAK-47706). However, these options are also not always ideal, since they ONLY let you do one item at a time. If you want 5 quizzes out of 20, you’d need to export and then import them one at a time - repeating the process 5 times. If you want 3 Lessons pages out of 15, you would have to repeat the process 3 times, once for each individual page. Also, there are some items that don’t copy when you copy a page individually this way in Lessons (i.e. LTI links or the content on subpages of the page you are copying).

I would like to propose a more granular approach to the selection of items for copying via Import from Site. This would allow instructors or site owners to have more control over the content they copy from one site to another, and save lots of time deleting things that were unnecessarily copied in the first place. Ideally, when selecting the tools for import, the user would also be able to expand a given tool and select a subset of items within that tool if desired. 

For most tools, this selection process should be relatively straightforward. However, for Lessons, which also contains links to content within other tools, the import will need to be smart enough to also include items from other tools which are linked on the selected Lessons pages. For example, if you select Lesson Page 1 to be copied, and that page includes Assignment 1, Quiz 1, Discussion 1, and links to 5 items within Resources, then all of the associated items in those other tools should be automatically selected for inclusion when the Lessons page is imported.

I’m including rough mockups of what the Import from Site content selection screen might look like.

Students by default see only the instructor role. Instructors may want to allow students to view all participants so they can see their peer’s name, profile, picture, and other profile information. The permission to view all participants includes all user’s Sakai profile picture, name, nickname, pronounciation, user ID, and role. Viewing the user’s email address is a separate permission that can be modified for the site. 

In the US, the user ID may not be directory information released by FERPA. There’s very few other locations in Sakai that allows students to see other student’s IDs. (only other one I could find was assignments group submissions) It seems odd that Roster does include the user ID if the default permission is changed to allow students to view their classmates. 

I would like to see viewing the user ID as a separate permission like email. Institutions that consider the User IDs to be directory information can then share them, and those that consider those protected information can allow students to view all participants without sharing the IDs.

With the LTI placement stuff changing, I think changes need to be made for stealthed tools and when the option is checked to allow tools to be selected from Lessons.

Currently, if a tool is stealthed and has only Lessons checked, the tool is not listed in Lessons for the instructor after the admin has added it to the site.

If a tool has both Lessons and navigation checked, it is added to the navigation, but not available for the instructor to add through Lessons.

I also tested adding the store as a stealthed tool, but I was certain it would not work (and it doesn’t).

What are the expectations for stealthed tools?

* Can only tools placed on the navigation be stealthed and added by the admin?
* If the Lessons option is checked, would you expect the instructor to be able to add the tool through Lessons, or expect it to automatically be added through Lessons?
* Or, if a tool is marked as stealthed, should the only placement option be site navigation and the other checkboxes disabled?
* Or would you expect the admin to check the box to create a site link when they add the tool to a site? 

With the changes to LTI placements and how things show up/don’t show up in site info > manage tools, possibly more instructions are needed also to make it clear what will/won’t work.",{},,,,To Do,1/21/2024 17:59

If the admin adds a tool only allowing placement in Lessons, the tool shows up when creating a site under Manage Tools. If the instructor adds the tool at this point, after the course is created, the tool is on the navigation but if they go into Site Info > Manage Tools it is not listed and cannot be removed.

If the instructor does not add the tool on site creation, then it works properly. When the instructor goes into Site Info > Manage Tools, the tool is not present. If the instructor enters Lessons and adds an external tool, it is listed there as expected.

It failed with my first site, so I created a second site, added the rubrics tool, but did not add a rubric, only created the student content pages to see if it would allow me to send them to the gradebook. I received the same error. I then tried a third site that didn’t have the rubrics tool even added and received the error also.

After adding student content pages and setting to send to the gradebook, the following error displayed on the page:

{quote}{color:#bf2600}This item couldn't be marked for grading. The most likely issue is that no Gradebook tool has been added to this site yet.{color}{quote}

Attendance > Take Attendance Now > Append Date to Default Attendance Item Title,SAK-49629,67155,Feature Request,Open,SAK,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Major,,,,John Buckingham,70121:fbb7b515-e767-4033-9ad8-f4f033da3b40,1/10/2024 12:58,1/11/2024 19:23,8/8/2024 1:36,,22.5,23.1,25.0 [Tentative],,Attendance(Use Github Issues),,"In the Attendance tool, instructors can take attendance on-the-fly by clicking the “Take Attendance Now” button. Once instructors have finished taking attendance, an attendance item with the default name of “Attendance” will populate in a table within the “Attendance” tab.

While this feature is useful, the default name of the Attendance item could benefit from some revision.

Assume an instructor regularly takes attendance on-the-fly by clicking “Take Attendance Now” at the beginning of every class. As the instructor accumulates attendance items, the table populates with more and more attendance items all with the same default title/name (i.e. “Attendance”). See screenshot #1 below.

!qkf9I19k1Zp0YDww9P7_Fx_2JvAYuqctKPM8q3pFkpqKS3ZyFH_UGAGRBMlJdYc03VkExI9aVtAUqQ2cyDKkjXpVsx2XtUtehV4kwK4XrKP51IaJ4ZzKKbwcr423is06adp69YAj1q31fAJtHFo9sqU|width=1194,height=666!

While it’s true that the table does display a “date” column to help distinguish between all these attendance items, it’s not natural or intuitive to distinguish items in the first column by way of data in another column. This also presents an accessibility challenge, given that each item in the leading column has the exact same value.

To help instructors who take attendance in this way, I propose that all attendance items append the date to the default name.

|*Legacy Naming Convention*|*Proposed Naming Convention*|
|Attendance|Attendance - [Date in mm/dd/yyyy format]|

For example, if the date is September 1, 2023, and an instructor selects “Take Attendance Now,” then the default name of the Attendance Item will be “Attendance - 09/01/2023.”

Tomcat 9.0.85.

Apache Tomcat 9 is an open source software implementation of the Java
Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Unified Expression Language, Java
WebSocket and JASPIC technologies.

Apache Tomcat 9.0.85 is a bugfix and feature release. The notable
changes compared to 9.0.84 include:

* Fix virtual thread support for the NIO2 connector

* Correct a regression in the fix for 67675 that broke TLS key file

   parsing for PKCS#8 format keys that do not specify an explicit
   pseudo-random function and rely on the default. This typically affects
   keys generated by OpenSSL 1.0.2.

* Allow multiple operations with the same name on introspected mbeans,

   fixing a regression caused by the introduction of a second
   addSslHostConfig() method.

Along with lots of other bug fixes and improvements.

This second option is particularly valuable for those instructors who wish to do some planning ahead of time. While instructors have the option to create and add another as they go, this process is manual and time consuming.

Instead, it would be helpful if instructors could create a repeating pattern of occurrence for the attendance with a start and stop date. 

Fortunately, this exact same functionality already exists in the Calendar tool (Go to Calendar, click “Add Event,” and scroll down to find the “Frequency” function). The exact same functionality could be added here (see mockup below).

Once the user has finished configuring the frequency, the user clicks save, finalizes the creation, and the attendance items will all pre-populate on the “Attendance” tab.

NOTE: I suggest that the attendance item names follow a formula, such that the distinction between them is clear. For example, “Attendance 1, Attendance 2, Attendance 3, Attendance … n” is one option.

We recently implemented [the new LTI 1.3 spec for working around the new third-party cookie block|https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti-cs-oidc/v0p1#platform-continue-with-oidc-auth-response-back-to-tool] and ran into an issue with Sakai. Sakai sends {{lti_storage_target}} in the initial OIDC request and we’re able to send an {{lti.put_data}} message with the state/nonce info, but after redirecting back to Perusall where we have to use {{lti.get_data}} to retrieve the state/nonce to check it, we no longer have information about what frame to send the {{postMessage}} call to. 

We’ve found that Canvas/D2L send {{lti_storage_target}} on both the initial OIDC request and the later POST to the redirect URL, and Blackboard only sends {{lti_storage_target}} on the initial OIDC request but their response to {{lti.capabilities}} includes the frame information for the {{lti.get_data}} entry. The issue we’re running into is that without either of these, the client-side page rendered by the redirect URL doesn’t know what frame to send the message to. We’re temporarily working around this by defaulting to {{_parent}} which is what Sakai seems to be using, but I’m wondering if Sakai would be willing to send this frame target in one of the above two ways? Or is there another way that Sakai intends for tools to access this info?

More From Brian:

Blackboard uses the {{frame}} parameter to indicate the target frame but does not add it as a GET parameter to the {{redirect_uri}}, and when I asked them about it their reason was exactly the same as yours — that they felt that the {{redirect_uri}} should not be changed in any way. Totally makes sense for it to be an additional POST parameter to preserve this rule.

I found the {{frame}} parameter in the spec here: [https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti-cs-pm/v0p1#platform-responds-with-a-target-frame-name|https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti-cs-pm/v0p1#platform-responds-with-a-target-frame-name|smart-link] . 

From Chuck:  I will add this to {{lti.capabilies}} data, and add it as a POST value when the JWT is posted.   Based on our conversations, and following Blackboard's lead, I don't want to ""hack"" the returned {{target_uri}} and add the parameter - hence sending it as post (like Blackboard).

But this Jira improved logging and has bee completed and committed to master.

If the instructor adds a GB item in the Plus site and grades a student, there are two grade events in the Plus log and also in the server logs.

This is not a Plus bug per se at this time - but because Gradebook sends events consistently, to make sure not to miss a change Plus errs on the side of sending two to avoid situations where we send zero.  [~accountid:557058:5489bdf1-0dcd-4429-8030-f007c405dfd0] has done a quick evaluation of what it would take to make sure that Gradebook does events consistently and once that is done, we can change plus to only listen to one event.

The grade book is sending two events.  This can be reproduced by turning on debug on

org.sakaiproject.grading.impl.GradingServiceImpl

And just editing a grade in the UI - you will see two events triggered in the log - and there is no Plus involved at all.  When Plus sees two events - it sends twice updated to the main server.  (See the screen shot of the log)

Now before we close this one - I will do some more investigation as to if this is a new behavior introduced in a GB change.  If it is new  I can do a bit of checking to see when it changed, who changed it and why.

But for now, this is not a big deal for Plus.

But --- As I was looking around and figuring it out, I noticed a few places where some debug.log’s could be added so I might want to commit those improvements on this JIRA.",,Done,4/2/2024 10:46

Currently, faculty have to either merge announcements for sites - which loses the ability to post announcements to each individual site, or copy & paste the text in to a new announcement in each site. There is also some discussion about removing the Merge option.

It may be convenient to have an option within the Announcements tool to post the same announcement to another site, similar to what Signup has. The instructor could then select which other sites should receive the same announcements and have it be posted to the selected site(s) with the same settings. 

Option 1, include groups - The “Other Sites” selection in Signup has the sites and any groups listed. If  “Only *members of this site* can see this announcement”, “This announcement is *publicly viewable*” or “Display this announcement *to selected roles* only” is selected, only the other sites are listed. If “Display this announcement *to selected groups* only”, the sites include their groups/sections listed below the site name.

Option 2, don’t allow cross-posting if released to groups - We could have the “other sites” option appear only if “Only *members of this site* can see this announcement”, “This announcement is *publicly viewable*” or “Display this announcement *to selected roles* only”, not if “Display this announcement *to selected groups* only” is selected under Access. This way, only the sites will need to be listed, not the various groups. If Role is selected, it would be released to the same role in any other site(s) selected.",{},,,,To Do,1/2/2024 15:07

This results in resource version problems for end users as tool resources are left in their 10.x state. We have seen several universities having to tell users to clear their caches for upgrades to 11.x to work.

I (the issue reporter) have started work, proposing the <sakai:script> and <sakai:stylesheet> taglibs to append version query automatically. But this is not enough as some tools rely on other templating engines.

Any insights for a more general solution would be greatly appreciated.
In the long term, it would be beneficial if all tool css-resources got collated by the portal /library scss build, minified and versioned. There should be similar strategies available for js resources, but I am not aware of any being in use in sakai at the moment.

The list of affected components is not complete. Will add more as I find them.

*LessonBuilder*, *Rwiki*, *Evaluation*, and *QnA* all use html/rsf templates. How do we best make these include a version query?

Steps to reproduce (but not a valid test strategy as it has a lot of manual steps):
1. Clear browser cache (as you might have 11.x resources from testing)
2. Log in to a Sakai 10.x install and use any affected tool
3. Upgrade to 11.x
4. Log in to 11.x
5. Use the same affected tool and verify the resources are loaded from server and not from cache

Note: This was discussed in the Core meeting on 19-Dec-2023 where we explored the possibility that this was a timing issue of initial creation of the grade book was being done by the dashboard tool and there was a race condition between multiple Gradebook web service requests both triggering the initial creation of the Gradebook.  The fix of this hypothetical race condition is to create the Grade book right after the site is created in the initial request to the Plus ProviderServlet.

Include Template sites in list of sites available for Site Import,SAK-49564,67089,Feature Request,Verified,SAK,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Major,Fixed,Adrian Fish,557058:5489bdf1-0dcd-4429-8030-f007c405dfd0,Wilma Hodges,557058:89b0bd66-0f67-42a4-b388-c7dbb7ceaa2d,12/11/2023 12:03,2/5/2024 11:33,8/8/2024 1:36,2/2/2024 3:04,23.1,25.0 [Tentative],,,Site Info,,"There are often use cases where it is desirable for instructors or site owners to copy site content from one site to another, but without being given an instructor/owner permissions in both sites. For example, many institutions develop Master Courses that are then used to populate multiple sections of that course being taught by different instructors. 

Currently, setting the template=”true” property for the Master Course allows users to select the template site when going through the Create Site workflow in Worksite Setup. However, if you have auto-created course shells (either as a result of SIS integration or LTI launch in the case of Sakai Plus) instructors do not need to create sites. Their empty course shells are already created for them. They just need to be able to import the content from the Master Course. 

Right now, the only way to do that is to have someone with instructor/owner permissions in both the Master Course and the new empty site go to Site Info > Import from Site and perform the course import from their personal list of sites. This means that either instructional designers (as editors in both sites) need to perform the import on behalf of faculty, or faculty need to be enrolled in the Master Course as instructor/owner. This is not ideal for several reasons: 1) It creates more work for instructional designers to copy information into many sites each term. 2) Enrolling faculty in Master Courses opens up the possibility of instructors inadvertently modifying the content in the Master site rather than their own individual site. 3) System administrators need to keep track of which Master sites instructors need access to, and they must manage that enrollment over time. 

I’d like to propose a small change in the Site Info > Import from Site workflow for adding content to an existing site. In the screen where a user selects the site/s from which to import content, template sites should be added to the list. (Template sites are labeled as such by the system administrator by adding the template=”true” property to the site.) Everything else in the Import from Site process would work the same way. This would allow instructors/owners of existing sites to easily select template or Master Course content for import into an existing course shell, without exposing the template site to the risk of accidental modification.

Please see a mockup of this import screen below. You will note that I’ve separated the Template sites from My Sites to emphasize the difference between the two types of sites.

A long time ago in a release far away, basic LTI was added to Sakai and it appeared in Lessons under “Add External Tool”.  The Content Item Launch was added and added to so LTI tools were either directly placeable or were a source of possibly many directly placeable tools.   These all showed up under Add External Tool in Lessons.  Then when Dayton really started to use Tsugi heavily they wanted to put the Content Item launch tools into their own “Add Learning App” and these were then removed from “Add External Tool”.  It was fine for a while, but as more and more LTI tools were integrated, a tool might appear one or the other of these areas in the Lessons menu with no real reason that made sense to the users.

Other LMS’s did not make users figure out which of the nearly two identical UI locations they might find a tool.   Instead they just listed all the tools and those that were sources of multiple tools had a little search icon so as to distinguish them without requiring two separate UI locations.

Sakai and other LMS’s had unnecessarily different UI’s when selecting LTI tools in the Rich Text Editor and Assignments.

The goal of this Jira is to produce “one true way” to choose LTI tools across Assignments, Lessons, and the Rich Text Editor and make it all more attractive and easier to use for the user.   

This coupled with [https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-49540|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-49540|smart-link] will lead to a very consistent UI across the various placements of External Tools in Sakai.","{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2024-07-08T22:44:17.000-0400"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""GitHub"":{""count"":1,""name"":""GitHub""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,"27/Jun/24 9:24 AM;557058:f58131cb-b67d-43c7-b30d-6b58d40bd077;A pull request has been created, ""SAK-49560 LTI Create a single ""Add Learning App"" UI to be used acros s Sakai"", you can see it at https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/pull/12687",,Done,7/8/2024 22:44

The new PDF viewer tools includes the ability to annotate the PDF file - add text, draw, or add/edit images.  I can foresee an instructor thinking that these options can be used for assignment feedback. However, these annotations are not saved by default. If an instructor uses these options, then clicks Save & Release and continues to the next student, the annotations are not saved and are not visible to the student.

The only way these annotations can be saved is if the instructor clicks the Save button to save a local copy (includes annotation) then uploads it back to the feedback attachment.

I think this would be very confusing for instructors who would expect that if they can make annotations, it saves annotations. I see three options for dealing with this - 

Option 1 - Save the annotations. Can these annotations be saved and released to the student as feedback? 

Option 2 - Hide the buttons. Can these three options be hidden, so instructors can’t add annotations that they can’t save?

Option 3 - Warn instructors. If we can’t save annotations or prevent them from being used, can we at least put up a banner when PDF files are submitted that warns instructors that PDF annotations are not saved unless they click the Save button to save a local copy, then upload it to the feedback attachments","{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=DECLINED, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2024-03-05T12:34:23.000-0500"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""DECLINED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""GitHub"":{""count"":1,""name"":""GitHub""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,"25/Jan/24 11:42 AM;557058:f58131cb-b67d-43c7-b30d-6b58d40bd077;A pull request has been created, ""SAK-49559 grader.

"Clean up LTI Placements, add Site Navigation Placement (i.e. left nav)",SAK-49540,67065,Bug,Closed,SAK,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Major,Fixed,Charles R Severance,557058:718cd3f6-5ff9-42fa-8914-b4224aff1730,Charles R Severance,557058:718cd3f6-5ff9-42fa-8914-b4224aff1730,12/3/2023 16:17,7/7/2024 13:43,8/8/2024 1:36,1/16/2024 11:43,,,,,LTI,,"Over the years, in the “External Tool” UI in the Admin Workspace, we have been evolving a set of check boxes that capture the message types a tool can accept and the placements in the Sakai UI that we want the tool to appear.  Launch message types and placements are very different concepts and in the old UI there was a bit of mixing.  And there was no “Left Nav” placement.  With this Jira these will appear as follows:

{noformat}Message Type:

    The tool URL can receive an LTI Resource Link launch
    The tool can receive a Content-Item or Deep-Link launch
    Tool supports the privacy launch message (experimental) -- moved from the placement list

Placement:

    Allow the tool to be selected from Lessons
    Allow the tool to be one of the assignment types
    Allow the tool to be used from the rich text editor
    Allow the tool to be placed in site-level navigation -- added
    Allow the tool to provide a common cartridge (usually to be imported into a tool like Lessons)
    Allow the tool to provide a file (usually as part of a file picker){noformat}

The privacy message indicator was moved under message type and a new placement (site navigation) was added.

With this change, the administrator can truly place an LTI tool wherever they like.  However there is still a problem.  Historically, code in Lessons, Site Manage, or whatever often did not strictly require a placement to be checked and instead “guessed” which tools belonged in which placements based on message types and other bits and bobs in the data model.

The worst example of this was how Site Info → Manage Tools worked.  Since prior to this Jira there was no ‘site-level’ navigation placement, to construct the list of external tools to show in Site info it would list a tool petty much if the tool could accept a resource link message.  This meant instructors saw tools that were not appropriate for the left navigation use case in Site Manage and there was no easy way for administrators to control what appeared there.  I am guessing that stealthing was used as a hack at times to hack / work around this limitation.

Immediately after this change, any placement of an LTI tool selector in Sakai will switch from ad hoc “guessing” what tools _might_ support this placement and erring on the side of more tools rather than fewer tools, each placement will only show tools which are marked as showing up in that placement (i.e. err on only including tools explicitly indicated for a placement).

So after this is put into production, some External Tools will disappear from some places in the the Sakai UI.   All the administrator has to do is go into the External Tool configuration and  explicitly indicate where the tool is to be placed.  It will require a bit of manual fixing for the admin to indicate placements explicitly but with this the admin can truly control what tools appear at what points in the Sakai UI.

In effect, the value of this Jira is that the Placement check boxes really work and tools only show up in a placement if the placement is checked.  In short, with this update, Sakai will consistently support placements  giving administrators a lot of flexibility and control.  Of course, with flexibility and control, there comes some responsibility.

This all has evolved slowly, where we introduced a placement type without requiring it to be checked in the name of upwards compatibility.  The placement and message types (other than site-nav) have been in the UI for years - so hopefully admins have been checking them to indicate where they want a tool to show up - and likely frankly confused at times when more than the checked tools show up with no way to stop them from showing up.  This will rationalize all that going forward.

Another change, now that the external tools appearing in Site Manage is under precise admin control, we won’t hide them under an expando section - they will just appear as a tool in the tool list - in alphabetical order with all the other tools.  (like other LMS’s that support course nav placements already do 🙂 )","{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2024-07-01T10:36:03.000-0400"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""GitHub"":{""count"":1,""name"":""GitHub""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,"05/Dec/23 2:15 PM;557058:718cd3f6-5ff9-42fa-8914-b4224aff1730;Note to self 🙂

This is problematic for several reasons:

 

1—The act of having the help content read aloud is happening without the screen reader user taking any explicit action to initiate it.

 

2—There is a lot of information being conveyed, way too much to be of any real use to a screen reader user who just happens upon this help content.

 

3—Based on extensive keyboard and screen reader testing, its unclear whether any of the keyboard tips and tricks that are described actually work.

 

(see attached demo video)

 

A more appropriate approach would be to:

 

A--Have the user first take some explicit action to select/activate the icon before any of the content gets read aloud;

 

B--Include some helper text for how users can access “Keyboard Navigation” instructions, similar to how users can press the ALT+0 shortcut to open the CK Editor keyboard command help topics (which actually redirects you to an external page) and pressing the Escape key will close the help topics  page and return focus to the “Rich text editor”/place the cursor back into the text box

 

or C--Remove the “Keyboard Navigation” icon altogether, since its impact for keyboard/screen reader users is negligible at best.",{},,01/Dec/23 10:39 AM;70121:edd71bdf-212f-4544-92f7-2fc8fb688af3;[~accountid:6164f6bd07ac3c00687375f2] can you see if this also affects Trunk?

Its description and test plan call for the instructor to be able to enter the extension date/time in the grader and then select ‘Save’.  However using only ‘Save’ results in a disabled submit button when the user tries to submit under the extension (see attached image) - 

As seen in nightly 23 when I executed that test plan, the student cannot submit the extended assignment because the Submit button is disabled. i.e. the test plan for [https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-46968|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-46968|smart-link] fails.

This may already be pointed in the SAK-46968 as the its test plan copied here shows red text in step 6 stating 

{color:#ff5630}“currently this does not work, the instructor has to save & release for the extension to become available to the student”{color}

Should that SAK be re-opened as it should be considered a bug that a “return” is needed to open the extension yet the student had not submitted. The student’s view shows ‘Returned’ in the status when opening the assignment. This could be confusing to the student.

Providing the ability for an extension without first needing to “return” could be used to grant an extension as an accommodation similar to the Exception option in Tests & Quizzes. Furthermore, the student would be able to see, when opening the assignment, the extension deadline as soon as it was granted be that before or after the assignment’s normal due date.","{repository={count=6, dataType=repository}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""repository"":{""overall"":{""count"":6,""lastUpdated"":""2024-03-25T18:47:12.000-0400"",""dataType"":""repository""},""byInstanceType"":{""GitIntegrationforJirabyGitKraken"":{""count"":6,""name"":""Git Integration for Jira by GitKraken""},""GitHub"":{""count"":4,""name"":""GitHub""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,"30/Jan/24 7:22 PM;557058:f58131cb-b67d-43c7-b30d-6b58d40bd077;A pull request has been created, ""SAK-49527 Assignments: Extension submit btn is disabled if instructor…"", you can see it at https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/pull/12326",,Done,3/23/2024 20:09

There are two separate types of color contrast issues involving two different elements, both of which I believe are links that appear on the Sakai Gateway page.

 

The first issue has to do with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) success criteria 1.4.1, and suggests that the color of the font used for the links lacks sufficient contrast from the surrounding text, and that styling should be used to add underlining to further help the link stand out for low-vision users.

 

The second, closely related issue is WCAG 1.4.3, which has to do with the foreground color of the text not having sufficient contrast from the background color being used.

 

I have attached an Excel spreadsheet with an excerpt from the AXE issues report which includes more detailed information about each of these specific instances","{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2024-01-08T16:36:09.000-0500"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""GitHub"":{""count"":1,""name"":""GitHub""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,"26/Dec/23 5:29 AM;557058:f58131cb-b67d-43c7-b30d-6b58d40bd077;A pull request has been created, ""SAK-49519 Accessibility: Address insufficient color contrast issues with text/links on Gateway page"", you can see it at https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/pull/12223",,Done,1/8/2024 16:36

In the future it will be necessary to work on extending this new feature to all the other tools. This ticket might be used for all of them or a different Jira could be created for each tool.

Some of the cases to deal with include: assignments, content-review, samigo, webservices, webapi, basiclti, msgcntr, attendance (contrib) and scorm-cloud (contrib).

Also please note the master version of gradebook is very different to the 22.x gradebook/edu-services one, so it will depend on whether [https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/S2U-26|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/S2U-26|smart-link] is contributed to master and the approach/development will probably be a bit different anyway.

[^GRE-150011.zip]

The file with the 769 character cannot be downloaded while accessing the submissions, while the other one works. In Tomcats before 9.0.71 there’s a 500 error, after that version there’s a warning and escapes the character.

This software change removes the non-ascii characters so Sakai works in versions before 9.0.71.

After all the investigation of those JIRAs it turns out the tutorial was the problem all along.

But during the review, in hopes of catching whatever error was happening, I strengthened some areas of the first launch code.

Some error messages have been improved, some error messages have been added, some extra checking has been added to catch inconsistencies in new site setup earlier, and the initial roster pull has been moved from a Thread in ProviderServlet to an Executor in the PlusServiceImpl - following the example in RefreshAuthZGroups.

So while it was working before and there is no user visible change, these changes should improve the long term performance and reliability of Plus launches.","{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2023-11-28T13:32:18.000-0500"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""GitHub"":{""count"":1,""name"":""GitHub""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,"21/Nov/23 12:44 PM;557058:f58131cb-b67d-43c7-b30d-6b58d40bd077;A pull request has been created, ""SAK-49486 - Plus: Improve Launch Logic and use Executor Pattern For NRPS Retrieval"", you can see it at https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/pull/12118",,Done,11/28/2023 13:32

You host knowledge checks/quizzes/exams in the Tests & Quizzes tool. For a given exam you may have something like:

* 3-4 student athletes who get an extra day to complete the exam.
* 1 student with a family emergency who gets an extra week to complete the exam.
* 2 students whom you want to extend the exam deadline given random, unplanned circumstances or issues. 
* 3 students who have the normal deadline but need time and a half on the exam.
* 2 students who have the normal deadline but need double the time on the exam.
* 1 person who gets time and a half, but also a deadline extension on the exam because he or she is out sick.

These are a lot of exceptions to create. 

For each exception, you must make new entries for the available date, the due date, the time limit, and the late submission deadline. You should remember to proofread all of these as you go, because you may have made a mistake somewhere. If you get interrupted at any point during this process and forget to click “Save,” you may lose some or all of this work.

With each new exam, you feel like you are drowning in exceptions and you need ways to speed up and/or make the exception creation process more efficient. 

To that end, I propose new functionality that would allow instructors to duplicate the exception settings of an existing exception. This way, instructors can capitalize on the hard work they’ve already done for an existing exception, and then make minor adjustments as needed for the duplicated exception.

In *Step 1* (see screenshot), an instructor could click a new “Duplicate” button next to an existing exception whose configuration they wish to mirror.

As *Step 2* (see screenshot) shows, once the instructor clicks the “Duplicate” button, the exception parameters (_except the user/group_) of the duplicated exception populates in the “Add New Exception” fields. From here, the instructor needs only select a different user/group and fine-tune any needed parameters.

For example, say an instructor wishes to keep the exam window of an existing exception the same (i.e. Available Date, Due Date, and Late Submission Date), and only make an adjustment to student/group user(s) and the time-limit. This process would allow the instructor to quickly duplicate the multiple entries of the existing exception and then simply update the intended user(s) and time-limit.

Note that, in this proposal, the “Duplicate” button isn’t technically _duplicating_ _an_ _exception_, per se. All it’s doing is auto-filling the “Add New Exception” fields with the configuration of the chosen exception to be duplicated. 

Once the instructor is finished with the edits, the instructor can just click “Add New Exception.”",{},,,,To Do,11/20/2023 17:17
Autoremoval of folders is not working with the new permissions,SAK-49483,67007,Bug,Closed,SAK,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Major,Fixed,Daniel Merino,5db0830566a99f0d9c5a0770,Daniel Merino,5db0830566a99f0d9c5a0770,11/20/2023 8:59,6/19/2024 11:59,8/8/2024 1:36,12/13/2023 3:42,22.4,23.1,25.0 [Tentative],25.0 [Tentative],Drop box,,"[https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-46030|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-46030|smart-link] changed the permissions of Dropbox, isolating them from Resources permissions.

In BaseContentService, in the method createDropboxCollection there is [some code|https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/blob/b9416148a257e174bb0167727baa54e99991e682/kernel/kernel-impl/src/main/java/org/sakaiproject/content/impl/BaseContentService.java#L10064] that tries to delete the folders of every non existing user in the site. Before the change, if the current user had the content.delete.any permission, the folders were deleted.

This behaviour has changed with the current permissions. The needed permission is dropbox.delete.any right now. However, this permission is disabled in [other code|https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/blob/b9416148a257e174bb0167727baa54e99991e682/kernel/kernel-impl/src/main/java/org/sakaiproject/content/impl/DropboxAuthzHandler.java#L125] of DropboxAuthzHandler, not allowing “destructive permissions”.

This causes that the folders are not deleted and logs reflects a WARN in every attempt:

{noformat}BaseContentService.createDropboxCollection createDropboxCollection(): Unable to delete collection due to lack of permission{noformat}

The exception says that “content.delete.any” is needed, but this permission is not used. The checked permission is “dropbox.delete.any” but is tagged as a “destructive permission” and not allowed.

Just allowing the destructive permissions (sending true as the last parameter of isAuthorizedOnEntity method) restores the old behaviour, but I’m afraid this could break other things.

I think that [~accountid:557058:3f0964c4-a9d3-4cc7-9473-78b4f46c68ad] should take a look, as he developed the new permissions.

Maybe [https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-47731|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-47731|smart-link] could be also related to this change, but I’m not sure.","{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2023-12-13T03:38:56.000-0500"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""GitHub"":{""count"":1,""name"":""GitHub""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,"20/Nov/23 11:27 AM;557058:3f0964c4-a9d3-4cc7-9473-78b4f46c68ad;I think the problem should be solved in BaseContentService.createDropboxCollection(…) where the empty folders are removed. I notice this cleanup code is 11 years old, and it’s silly design to do cleanup in the operation that creates drop boxes. I suggest this should be refactored into a different method.

Now, here’s my thoughts on how to do such a clean up. Given the following collections:

# /group-user/siteId/<user ID 1; still in the site>
## Empty
# /group-user/siteId/<user ID 2; no longer in the site>
## Empty
# /group-user/siteId/<user ID 3; no longer in the site>
## Contains items
# /group-user/siteId/<not a user Id, just a site maintainer’s sibling collection>
## Empty

We don’t want to delete collections that were created manually by site maintainers as in case 4 (even if this collection is empty). The only collection we’d want to clean up in these cases is case 2, which meets all of the following conditions:

* The collection reference matches a user ID who is in the system
* That user is no longer a member of the site
* The collection is empty

If it’s still desirable to do this clean up from user sessions who don’t have dropbox.delete.any, I think this is an acceptable case to use a SecurityAdvisor",,Done,12/13/2023 3:42

Issue

First, we are grateful to the community for making the background color for Tests & Quizzes available again! This is an optional feature (see SAK-49293). While reviewing this feature, we see two concerns/areas for improvement. 

# *Picker Default Color*. The picker’s default color seems to be black (#000000). We are worried that some professors may think that they need to set or change the color, otherwise the background will be black. This isn’t true, of course. The color will only change if a Hex value is present in the input field. But we foresee possible confusion by some professors (and unnecessary selection of a color which may impact user skin selections).
# *Picker Location Offset*. The picker’s location is below the box. This is not an ideal placement. It would be more intuitive for the input box and the picker to be in alignment.

h1. Proposals

# *Change Picker Default Color to White* (#ffffff)
## We would like the default color for the picker to match the default color for the assessment (which is generally white (#ffffff)). Our intent is to avoid faculty confusion that the background will be black (#000000) and they think they need to set a color (when they don’t need to unless they want a special color).
## Another option would be to add a system property or option for an institution to set the starting color of the picker. Perhaps a school might want to set the color to match a university brand color or something.
# *Align Picker with the Input Box*
## Please move the picker to appear to the right of the input box for the Hex value. This looks more professional, and it’s more intuitive for the tool to align with the field that will be affected by it.

Looks better updating the current CSS because ‘toggle_link_container’ is aligned on the right side.

Essentially, we need a way for an individual user to select and download all of their own file attachments/submissions for all sites in which they a member. (Other LMSs like [Canvas |https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-download-assignment-submissions-from-all-my-courses/ta-p/298]let users do this.) 

It would be really nice if there were a way to do this in Sakai. I’m attaching a rough mockup of what the UI for this might look like and where it could be located. I’m thinking that putting the option within the Account Menu might make sense, but it could also potentially live within Preferences or Profile.

I’ve added several components to this Jira, since students submit files in a number of different places, and while Assignments would be the primary place to look for submissions, they might also exist in other tools. We would need to figure out if it is possible to include other tools besides Assignments in the download. If it is possible to include things like Discussion posts/attachments, Tests & Quizzes submissions, etc. then we might also want to include an option to select the tool in addition to the type of submission. (I’ve only included type in my image below.) Or, at a minimum, if it is only feasible to make this work in Assignments, then some explanatory text at the top should tell users exactly what is included, in order to set appropriate expectations.

In reviewing the mockups, we thought that perhaps the selection screen for students could be simplified. Students probably don’t know/care about the submission type (inline vs file), but they might be more inclined to select items based on the tool. Perhaps the “course” selection options could be an expandable list showing items within courses grouped by tool, and then by title. You could select everything in a course by leaving it collapsed, or expand it to select only certain tool items or individual submissions if desired. For example, the expandable list might look something like this:

Problems not addressed in the other Jiras, but were reported in [SAK-47559], which only covered adding back some code:

*Accessibility* from [~accountid:6164f6bd07ac3c00687375f2] - For the “*Final Grade Distribution*” on the “Statistics” page, the ranges are still being reported as “Starting with X less than Y” which probably needs to be updated in the ARIA??

*Accessibility - Completeness graph* from [~accountid:6164f6bd07ac3c00687375f2] - In the “Questions” section, the graphs for the “Completeness” field are reported as “progress bar”--it sounds like these are either green or blue to indicate “correct” or “incorrect” responses so wondering if that should be reflected in the alt text that gets read out by the screen reader? (i.e. “33 green progress bar” or “66 blue progress bar”)

*Hotspot from* [~accountid:70121:edd71bdf-212f-4544-92f7-2fc8fb688af3] - Statistics shows “No Responses” at the bottom of the graph, where all of the other questions show “X responses, Y% Answered Correctly”. There were responses, and correct responses for the questions.

*Accessibility issue for Hot Spot* from [~accountid:6164f6bd07ac3c00687375f2] - The progress bars for the “Hot Spot” questions are still being reported as “0 progress bar” even though it shows that there are responses for these. Moreover, it says “No responses” down under the table so something’s still not right??

*Matrix Survey* Questions from [~accountid:70121:edd71bdf-212f-4544-92f7-2fc8fb688af3] - Matrix Survey - All bars at 100%, not proportional to the number of responses out of the total number of responses. Is this expected?

*Accessibility issue for Matrix of Survey* from [~accountid:6164f6bd07ac3c00687375f2] - Questions with multiple responses are confusing, because some of the choices have a single response, but others have two or three, but they all say “100 progress bar” (I know on one of my previous comments in Jira I questioned why one of the responses was labeled “300 progress bar” but now I’m starting to understand that this was just a way to verbally describe the difference between a bar graph that was 1 unit long vs. a bar graph that was 3 units long, or 300% longer)

The bars for correct answers that were missing after the accidental removal of code are present again, (though purple but addressed in [SAK-48816]).",{},,"14/Nov/23 9:11 AM;6164f6bd07ac3c00687375f2;RE: the summary of accessibility-related issues referenced in the “description” field, I believe this recent comment from SAK-47559 more accurately describes the unresolved accessibility issues with the Tests & Quizzes Statistics page…



“I went back and completed the keyboard/screen reader testing for SAK-47559 on 23.X, 22.X, and 21.X.

1--It appears that the final grade distribution values are still being reported as” starting with X and less than Y” (as opposed to “X through Y”)

2—I think I now understand why the bar graphs are labeled as “33 progress bar” or “66 progress bar” or whatever, but it sounds like these are either green or blue to indicate “correct” or “incorrect” responses so wondering if that should be reflected in the alt text that gets read out by the screen reader? (i.e. “33 green progress bar” or “66 blue progress bar”)

3—Down below the tables, for each question type, it says something like “(X number of) responses, (X)% answered correctly” which helps to clarify any of the proceeding information in the stats distribution table (I’m not sure if this is how this was set-up before, and I somehow missed/overlooked it, but I like how this is presented.)

4—For “Part 5 – Survey Questions”—some of the questions with multiple responses are confusing, because some of the choices have a single response, but others have two or three, but they all say “100 progress bar” (I know on one of my previous comments in Jira I questioned why one of the responses was labeled “300 progress bar” but now I’m starting to understand that this was just a way to verbally describe the difference between a bar graph that was 1 unit long vs. a bar graph that was 3 units long, or 300% longer)

5—The progress bars for the “Hot Spot” questions are still being reported as “0 progress bar” even though it shows that there are responses for these. Moreover, it says “No responses” down under the table so something’s still not right??”",,To Do,11/13/2023 19:22

Also, the tutorial pops up on first launch.

I also noticed that if you don’t press enter and just keep tabbing that it doesn’t _quite_ work as you’d expect either. -I also don’t know how to get out of the table once you get into it?- Looks like you can get out with the escape key. 

I’m also reading that

“By default, the {{<thead>}} element and its contents do not receive keyboard focus unless they contain focusable elements with explicit {{tabindex}} values.”

I tried some javascript to set tabindex=0 on all of the thead’s and elements but that didn’t change anything. Not sure what this is missing. I think this needs to be more targeted but I figured something might happen. 

{noformat}  // Get all thead elements on the page
  var allTheads = document.querySelectorAll('thead');

  // Loop through each thead and set tabindex
  allTheads.forEach(function(thead) {
    thead.tabIndex = 0;

    // Set tabindex for all th elements inside thead
    var thElements = thead.getElementsByTagName('th');
    for (var i = 0; i < thElements.length; i++) {
      thElements[i].tabIndex = 0;
    }
  });{noformat}

"Modify the default behaviour of the ""mark as read"" in the forums tool.",SAK-49440,66964,Feature Request,Open,SAK,Core Team,6164d8abc7bea400699b1b9e,Major,,Jesus Maria Mendez Perez,557058:41fcbac4-a91a-45ed-b774-07f473189e6d,Eduardo Rey Jara,6164e4a69cdb930072de1f6e,11/10/2023 2:24,2/8/2024 7:19,8/8/2024 1:36,,22.4,25.0 [Tentative],,,Forums Tool,,"This is a suggestion made to us by a group of teachers in our institution and we thought it was quite reasonable.

In some of our subjects we make quite a lot of use of the Virtual Classroom Forum, and I wanted to suggest a change to the 'Mark as read' functionality, which I think could improve the user experience for teachers and students.

As the tool is currently configured, it is not enough to read a message for it to be marked as read, but you have to click on the 'Mark as read' sign. In other words, the default option is that the message is not marked as read, even if it has been opened for viewing.

Naturally, most people who use the tool do not take the trouble to mark as read every message they have read, and this has two undesirable consequences:

(1) When a teacher checks the number of messages that a student has read, he/she sees the number of messages that he/she has clicked on as read, instead of the number of messages that he/she has opened and presumably actually read. So, if a student does not take the trouble to mark as read each message that he/she has actually read, it may appear to the teacher that he/she has not read any of them, which may result in an unfair assessment of his/her attention to the Forum.

If the aim is to avoid the mischievousness of students opening messages and closing them quickly, without having actually read them, it should be pointed out that this mischievousness is not avoided by the requirement to 'mark as read'. This is so for two quite obvious reasons: firstly, because a student can open messages and mark them as read quickly, without reading them. And secondly, because the tool itself allows one to stand at the top of a conversation and mark all messages as read one after the other, without even opening them.

(2) The second undesirable consequence of the current configuration is that when a person (whether teacher or student) opens a message in the Forum, the number of people who have read it is indicated. But this number, once again, does not correspond to the people who have opened that message and presumably have in fact read it, but corresponds to the people who have clicked on those messages as read.

The result is that a message may appear as having been read by 2 participants when in fact it has been read by 25. I therefore suggest that the default option of the tool should be that when a message is opened and the text is displayed, it is automatically marked as read.

And along with this suggestion, I would like to make an additional and complementary suggestion, and that is that the little boxes that currently allow you to 'Mark as read' messages, be changed to precisely the opposite, 'Mark as unread', for the special case in which someone wants to highlight a message to read it again later.

Moreover, this change is more in line with the reality of the words themselves: if I open a message to read it, it is normal to assume that I have read it. The requirement to mark it as read is, in my view, an excessive and unjustified burden.

Finally, it should be noted that in other communication tools, such as email managers or wassaps, it is unthinkable that the tool would require you to mark every message you open as read. The default option is 'message open = message read'. And the special option is that there is a procedure to 'mark as unread' a particular message, despite having opened it, because you want to remember it for whatever reason.

However the import process now takes 3x times more than before and this is huge in big sites with many exams with many questions, and that’s caused by the way it gets the association to the question, it queries the table once per question, per exam, in our case takes around 0.7 seconds per question.

I cannot reproduce the “Current Behavior” described by the test plan in step 4, it works as expected and displays the rubric. There is 404 error in the console. There is a message after that a 404 may be expected.

I cannot reproduce the “Current Behavior” described by the test plan in step 7, it works as expected with no errors. 

I’m not sure what page/link step 8 refers to so I can’t proceed in the test plan. I don’t see where to change the gradebook item in step 9.

I see this was created Nov 8, perhaps it’s been incorporated since then? Or is it still a problem for you under some other environment conditions (like browser, user, server, etc?) I didn’t create any special rubric, just went into there and clicked “Add Rubric” with the default.

I looks like there’s _potential_ for some issues if using weighted rubrics, were you doing anything else not mentioned in the steps? ",,To Do,12/4/2023 9:11

* Edit quiz name by going under edit -> settings -> about assessment then save and republish

When editing the quiz name you would not republish, it’s just a Save and then the Assessment List page displays again, so I think if you try it again, it will work.

Sometimes the rubric selections are saved and other times they’re not.  Comments are not kept when added through the questions tab, and when grading  new student, clicking on the comments icon will load the comment from a previous student. There is also a console error when trying to add a comment to the rubric through questions. The score is passed, though, even if sent to the GB.

Clicking on a student’s name on the Total Scores page and loading the entire quiz does not seem to cause any problems when grading the rubric.

I made this critical, but I can see this being a blocker. If an instructor uses the Questions tab for grading, they will not have a clue that selections may/may not display to the student, and that comments do not get saved at all.

Console error when adding a comment to a rubric from the questions tab:

Since this type of question must otherwise be manually scored, the Minimum Point Value saves valuable time for instructors. 

See image below of the current UI for this feature: 

!min-pt-value-current.jpg|width=75%!

However, the Minimum Point Value would be a much more useful feature if it also included the ability to set some basic criteria for the content of the submission, such as Word Count and Keywords. Instructors may still want to review and adjust the points awarded, but having these additional options makes the auto-scoring of the student submissions a little bit smarter.

Many instructors specify word count for essay questions, and this would allow them to enter the word count minimum in order for the points to be awarded. 

In addition, the ability to optionally include a set of comma-delimited keywords would also allow instructors to make sure that certain required text content is at least mentioned in the submission before awarding the points. 

Below is the proposed UI with the two additional (optional) criteria:

Results:

* Even if the instructor sets the submissions to unlimited, the student does not get another launch button after the first submission
* 1.1 grading works the same as on 25/23: the instructor has to click Student Data from the Instructor drop-down and then is able to grade the student
* 1.3 grading: the grader is hidden, the grading page for Sticky Grader is displayed and the instructor can grade
* In both 1.1 and 1.3, grades are passed back to the assignment submissions screen and releasing the grade then pushes it to the GB and the student is able to see the grade

The test plan describes a simplified, boiled down version of a general problem I’ve observed, though the test plan reproduces the problem reliably. That said, there may be exceptions to the following statements of related behavior I’ve generally observed.

The order of hiding gradebook items and then adding new rubrics seems to be key to causing this bug. After those user events, the missing ‘Grade Rubric’ option bug seems to persist when gradebook items are hidden which is very common for gradebooks with more than a handful of items (so as to workaround horizontal scrolling, etc.)

To workaround the problem, the instructor seems to need to ‘Show All’ the items. Then the gradebook item(s) associated with rubrics seem to have the ‘Grade Rubric’ option available for their cells.

Using the Sakai Grader, the “graded” rubric does not display the score the students set for themselves or have the selected cells highlighted. There are some console errors but I believe they are related to rubrics and don’t have anything to do with this feature.

If the instructor selects Student Summary or Criteria Summary from the drop-down, they are able to see the scores the students assigned to themselves. 

Since this has been merged to trunk, I would expect the instructor to be able to use the Sakai Grader.

{{51b3c7f}}

We have just released version 6.0.10 of the [UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java|https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk]. It is available for download from [GitHub|https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/releases] and [SourceForge|https://sourceforge.net/projects/ldap-sdk/files/], and it is available in the [Maven Central Repository|https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.unboundid/unboundid-ldapsdk/6.0.10]. You can find the release notes for the 6.0.10 release (and all previous versions) at [https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/release-notes.html|https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/release-notes.html|smart-link] , but here’s a summary of the changes:

* We added a new {{ReusableReferralConnector}} interface that makes it possible to create referral connectors that can be reused for following multiple referrals. We’ve added a new {{PooledReferralConnector}} implementation that uses connection pools for improved performance when following multiple referrals.
* We fixed an issue in which the {{parallel-update}} tool could write malformed data to the reject log file when multiple write operations were rejected concurrently.
* We added a {{PLAINBindRequest.encodeCredentials}} method that can be used to retrieve the encoded credentials for a SASL PLAIN bind request.
* We added {{JSONNumber.getValueAsInteger}} and {{getValueAsLong}} methods that will return the value of a JSON number as an {{Integer}} or {{Long}}, but only if the conversion can be made losslessly. The methods will return {{null}} if the value is a floating-point number, or if the value is outside the supported range for the data type.
* We added a {{StaticUtils.getBacktrace}} method that can be used to retrieve a compact, single-line string representation of a stack trace representing the code location from which the method was called.
* We added support for a new Ping-proprietary “access log field” request control, which can be used to indicate that the server should include a specified set of name-value pairs in the access log message for the associated operation. We also updated the {{ldapsearch}} and {{ldapmodify}} tools to add a new {{--accessLogField}} argument to include this control in requests.
* We added support for a new Ping-proprietary “generate access token” request control that can be included in a bind request to indicate that the server should include an access token in a corresponding response control included in the response to a successful bind operation. That access token can be used to authenticate to the Ping Identity Directory Server with the OAUTHBEARER SASL mechanism. This may be especially useful when initially authenticating to the Directory Server with a mechanism that relies on single-use credentials (e.g., UNBOUNDID-TOTP, UNBOUNDID-DELIVERED-OTP, or UNBOUNDID-YUBIKEY-OTP) because it allows you to establish multiple connections (e.g., using a connection pool or to replace connections that are no longer valid). We also updated the {{ldapsearch}} and {{ldapmodify}} tools to add a new {{--generateAccessToken}} argument to request that the server return an access token in the bind response.
* We updated support for the {{ds-pwp-state-json}} virtual attribute to include the {{has-password-encoded-with-non-current-settings}} field, which may indicate whether the user has a password that is encoded with settings that are different from the current configuration for the associated password storage scheme, and the {{non-current-password-storage-scheme-settings-explanations}} field, which may explain the ways in which the password encoding differs from the current configuration.
* We updated the documentation to include the latest versions of draft-ietf-kitten-scram-2fa, draft-melnikov-scram-bis, and draft-melnikov-scram-sha3-512 in the set of LDAP-related specifications.","{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2023-10-13T08:56:36.000-0400"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""GitHub"":{""count"":1,""name"":""GitHub""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,"13/Oct/23 8:22 AM;557058:f58131cb-b67d-43c7-b30d-6b58d40bd077;A pull request has been created, ""SAK-49362 Update UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java 6.0.10"", you can see it at https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/pull/11993",,Done,10/13/2023 8:56

Tomcat 9.0.81 Released

The Apache Tomcat Project is proud to announce the release of version 9.0.81 of Apache Tomcat. This release implements specifications that are part of the Java EE 8 platform. The notable changes compared to 9.0.81 include:

* Update Tomcat Native to 1.2.39 to pick up Windows binaries built with OpenSSL 3.0.11.
* Provide a lifecycle listener that will automatically reload TLS configurations a set time before the certificate is due to expire. This is intended to be used with third-party tools that regularly renew TLS certificates.
* Improve performance of EL expressions in JSPs that use implicit objects.
* Several improvements to thread safety and recycling cleanup.

It will be throwing the JPA object directly to parse to JSON... and of course as in JPA that is lazy... if you don't ask for the createBy property it will NEVER create that second user... But when parsing to JSON the parser does look for ALL THE PROPERTIES...

It is possible that ROSTER does not use the createdBy or the modifiedBy of the user for anything, but it spends hours of CPU in mapping recursively to JSON.

If you are viewing the site in light mode, the light colored buttons are legible because the black text on the light colors (for example, gold or blue) has sufficient contrast. However, dark button colors (such as black or dark navy) have illegible text, since the black button labels do not adjust to the color of the button. See image below.

I want to note that since [https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-41754|https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-41754|smart-link] was introduced the {{isDefault}} property was not really used (without setting {{profile2.avatar.initials.enabled}}), since using the initials will also have {{isDefault=false}}.

I think this case should either be handled, or the property should be removed together with a cleanup in ProfileImageLogic in case it is not used.

As you can see in the screenshot the default image does also not display really well (round). I suppose it is not used much.

So for 24 & 23 (and going forward), the URL entered in Site Info > Edit Site Info > *Icon URL* actually affects the image in the Dashboard and would not be an icon, but an actual image. 

In the Dashboard > Edit Dashboard, you can change the image, but this also affects the Site Info > Icon URL. 

Since it seems the decision was made to not have an icon display in the navigation, the link between the Dashboard image/Icon URL in site info edit should be disconnected from creating an icon in the navigation for 24 & 23, and only update the image for the Dashboard.

Christina’s comments in the linked Jira:

{quote}For the T&L Discussion - this site icon is also tied to the Dashboard layout 2 course image. Adding an image to the Dashboard puts <https://<server>/access/content/group/<siteID>/site_icon_image.png> in the course icon URL field, and removing the URL is how you can reset the Dashboard image back to the default city image.

I think the icon not appearing above the tool menu was a desired behavior because in 22, initially any Dashboard course image also appeared in the site icon area. The two use the same image and you couldn’t have one without the other.{quote}",{},,"02/Feb/24 8:49 AM;70121:edd71bdf-212f-4544-92f7-2fc8fb688af3;Since the dashboard and site icon images are now separated, would this be a non-issue?
